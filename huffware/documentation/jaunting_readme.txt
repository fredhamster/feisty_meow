Jaunting is our term for teleporting around the grid.  The term jaunt comes
from 'The Stars My Destination' by Alfred Bester and we refer to it in a
similar context.

The jaunting library script is the useful encapsulation of a variety of
teleportation and movement control methods.  It is interfaced to via a
huffware API for remote procedure calls.
