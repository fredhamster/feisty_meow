* our store is called Eclectic Electric Patterns and Widgets (eepaw).  we started out in Second life, but have since branched out into opensim based simulators.  we have two locations for the store now, one in osgrid that is all ++freebies++, and another store in second life that is a mix of commercial objects and freebies (because the linden labs dingbats insist on charging exorbitant rates to rent space on their servers).

* in osgrid: our brand new freebie store (as of march 2011) is in wright plaza at <228, 22, 21>
    [ or http://slurl.com/secondlife/Wright%20Plaza/228/22/21 ].
this will be our base of operations from now on, or until there's no power left in the global electrical grid.
a lot of our new stuff will be available here first, and for free to osgrid avatars.
please don't upload our stuff into second life, because that store (see below) kind of needs to pay for itself.  render unto caesar and all that.  so, thanks.

* in second life: the eepaw shop is located way out in the "smoky" region of the atoll (heterocera).  Feel free to mosey over and check our other strange devices out, many others of which are also totally free...
