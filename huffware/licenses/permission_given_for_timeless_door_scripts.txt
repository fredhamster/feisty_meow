[2011/04/02 09:20]  Fred Huffhines: hi timeless.  i wanted to thank you for your timeless linked door script.  that thing is great.
[2011/04/02 09:20]  Fred Huffhines: i am wondering if you are okay with my reusing it in osgrid and opensim environments.  i have been using it a lot for doors there.
[2011/04/02 09:21]  Fred Huffhines: also, i think you have the most rational attitude for friend requests i've ever seen.  i friended you on that basis.  thanks again for the scripting.  i also am a scripter, but not so nearly crucial in the SL infrastruc
