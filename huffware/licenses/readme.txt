the files starting with "license--" are for objects that have been
released as full-permission in osgrid and second life...

license--freebie_in_the_metaverse_v1.8.txt
  this license applies to objects that are completely free to copy,
  share, disassemble, etc in any simulator grid.

license--free_in_osgrid_and_personal_opensims_only_v1.9.txt
  this license applies to objects that have been freed for osgrid only.
  users within non-open grids such as second life do not have any rights to
  these objects beyond their being available for sale by fred huffhines.
  second life restricts user freedoms, and thus we must keep our copyrights
  from being trampled upon by them (see second life's third party viewer
  rules for more details).

permission_given_for_timeless_door_scripts.txt

  scripts within other grids besides SL (where they were already open source).
