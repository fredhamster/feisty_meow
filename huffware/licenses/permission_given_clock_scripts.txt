[2011/04/02 12:06]  Fred Huffhines: hi beezle, i'm interested in whether you have any licensing terms associated with your clock scripts.  i found that i am using hour hand and minute hand in one of my objects.
[2011/04/02 12:06]  Fred Huffhines: i actually have extended it by adding a menu to pick the time zone, if you're interested.  but i wanted to make sure what rules you had for re-use of the scripts.  thanks, fred.
[2011/04/02 15:33]  Beezle Warburton: Oh, I released those "into the wild" years ago, do what you like, I just ask that people don't resell the scripts by themselves.
[2011/04/02 16:25]  Fred Huffhines: great, thanks a lot.  yes, i sell a clock that happens to use the hour and minute hand, but it's not just selling the scripts alone.
[2011/04/02 16:25]  Fred Huffhines: would you like the time zone extension, or is that not needed?  and thanks for your open source attitude.  -fred
