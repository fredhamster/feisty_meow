This folder is in active development, but it is intended to hold all of the
LSL (linden scripting language) free and open source assets from our
adventures in osgrid, opensim and second life.

In the metaverse, the source is distributed inside huffotronic updater
objects, which are active repositories of the source code that can update
other objects to the newest version.  We provide those huffotronic updaters
in the "latest_iars" folder (in opensim IAR format).

All of the huffware / huffotronic scripts can be found in text file format
in the "huffotronic_scripts" folder.  This should be close to the latest
versions of all the scripts that are currently free source.

Note that the updater object must have 'huffotronic' in its name for the
huffotronic update server and client scripts to work properly.

Also note that these products are currently licensed according to this file:
"licenses/license--free_in_osgrid_and_personal_opensims_only_v1.9.txt"
