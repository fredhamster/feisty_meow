This folder is still under development, but it is intended to hold all of the
LSL (linden scripting language) open source assets from our adventures in
osgrid, opensim and second life.

In the metaverse, the source is distributed inside huffotronic updaters, so
that's our organizational scheme for the moment.

Note that the updater must have 'huffotronic' in its object name for the
huffotronic update server and client scripts to work properly.
