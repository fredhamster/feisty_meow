There are a few pre-built binaries included with hoople.
They originate from a few different sources.  Feel free to not trust them.

These apps are external to the HOOPLE build...

build/msys hierarchy:
  This is copied directly from the msys project of MingW.
  It has had zip.exe, unzip.exe and short_path.exe added to it.

    unzip.exe & zip.exe:
      The zip and unzip tools are from the info-zip project.  They are somewhat
    antiquated but still work great on the various 32-bit windows platforms.
    These utilities are self-identified as: "Zip 2.3 (November 29th 1999)"
    To get a more recent version of the zip utilities or build them yourself,
    they can be found at the site: http://www.info-zip.org/

    short_path.exe:
      Built by the hoople bootstrapping process, but unfortunately this tool
    is desperately needed for windows builds to work nicely with clam and
    bash.  It can be replaced by any newer working version from the bootstrap.
