This is the feisty meow examples folder.  It has the following folders...

bashisms/
  A few examples of techniques in bash.  Handy to keep track of these.

legacy/
  Examples of quixotic attempts at whatever in the past.  One example is an
  aged attempt to add C++ template features to a C++ compiler that did not
  already have them.  It was never completely finished.

os_related/
  Both frivolous and serious scripts related to a particular operating system.
  Do *NOT* run the OS_crusher scripts unless you are in complete control of
  the system in question, and do not like that computer system very much,
  as they may likely take it down.

perlisms/
  Examples of techniques using the perl scripting language.
