# this script is a collection of helpful bash practices that unfortunately
# sometimes slip my mind when i need them.  it's intended to collect all the
# good bits so they don't slip away.  feel free to re-use them in your own
# code as needed.

# clean for loops in bash:

for ((i=0; i < 5; i++)) do
  echo $i

# removing an array element
# --> only works on arrays that have no elements containing a space character.

# define a 5 element array.
arr=(a b c d e)

# remove element 2 (the 'c').
removepoint=2

# set the array to slices of itself.
arr=(${arr[*]:0:$removepoint} ${arr[*]:(($removepoint+1))} )

# show the new contents.
echo ${arr[*]}
# shows: a b d e

# store to a variable name by derefercing it.

# shows how you can store into a variable when you are given only its name.
