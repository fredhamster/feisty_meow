# when the array elements have spaces, it is still possible to get them back right.


a=("ted row" "boon" "moopy dongle")
echo ${#a[@]}
# 3
borg=( "${a[@]}" )
echo ${#borg[@]}
# 3

# normally the setting of borg would not preserve the elements with spaces in them as separate.
# but by using the @ to get all the array members and the spaces around the reference, you get
# the list back properly.
