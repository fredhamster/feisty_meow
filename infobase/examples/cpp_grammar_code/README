Bug reporting
-------------

Please report any bugs to Ed.Willink@rrl.co.uk. I will endeavour to fix them,
but since this code is a one man effort and my time is primarily devoted to
my other activities for Thales Research, only simple and easy fixes are likely.
I am more likely to be able to fix the problem if you can trim your problem to
just a few lines.
