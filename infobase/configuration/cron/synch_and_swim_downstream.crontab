#[synch and swim downstream]
# updates local code repositories from master versions before uploading any changes to downstream
# repositories, such as sourceforge or github.  the uploading process (which we think of as sending
# those updated items swimming downstream to their dependent repositories) is done automatically in
# our makefiles.  that's why the code below relies on the top-level makefile in home.
