this is an example of running quake3 in dedicated server mode and with
no console.  the config file can be swapped out for other ones.

nohup quake3 +set dedicated 1 +exec fred_free_for_all.cfg &

the fred_...cfg file needs to be in the quake3/baseq3 directory unless
the directory where it is stored is pointed at using q3 command line options
that i don't know but which i have heard of.

this just automates the copying of the config file before running quake.

cp $FEISTY_MEOW_APEX/infobase/quake3/fred_free_for_all.cfg /usr/local/games/quake3/baseq3/ ; nohup quake3 +set dedicated 1 +exec fred_free_for_all.cfg
