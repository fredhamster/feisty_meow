the walrus utilities was originally a collection of useful apps that i kept on the hard drive or on CDs, because at the time, it was slow to download things off the internet.
that morphed over time to being a collection that lived on a hard drive and was backed up to cds, then dvds, then even blurays.
the collection also got so fat that it split into different parts, kind of like mitosis.  the "walrus utilities" remained as the set of useful apps and tools that i use frequently; the "walrus coding" collection was a big pile of different tools for doing programming work; the "walrus albums" collection is my personal set of pictures; the "walrus games" set is a bunch of game save files for things i'm working on or want to keep track of; and the "walrus media" collection is all sorts of pictures, sounds, and movies i want to hang onto.
however, software gets updated so quickly now that it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep a bunch of old binaries around, so now the walrus utils are just lists of good apps to use for various purposes.
the walrus coding collection went through a similar metamorphosis and is now just a set of links to great programming apps.
all the static collections remain as they are (pictures, etc) and since they are very personal, or i don't have copyrights on them, they're not available here.  but the utilities and coding tools are!  wheee!
the lists are incomplete, and reflect my personal choices, but they may be a helpful starting point if you're looking to get something done on linux.
