vim, which is an improved version of vi, is our current day-to-day handy
editor.  it's great and is available for every platform.  on linux, there
is a nice gnome version called gvim.

emacs is the powerhouse lisp editor that was the first IDE we used to use.
it's really extensible and is currently the dark horse contender for best
editor.

a new combo of the above two can be found in the spacemacs toolset,
which turns emacs into a user-friendly menued editor, sort of, supposedly.
