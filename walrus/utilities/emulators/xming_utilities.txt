xming is great.
xming gives you the x windowing system on platforms that don't typically have x.
it lets you run an x-server locally so that you can see the apps launched remotely by
ssh sessions.

the packages i usually install on windows are:

Xming-ver#-setup.exe
    gives you the basic xming package with an x-server.

Xming-fonts-ver#-setup.exe
    provides extra fonts that make the windows look nicer in x.

Xming-portablePuTTY-ver#-setup.exe
    a version of the putty software for ssh that understands xming.
