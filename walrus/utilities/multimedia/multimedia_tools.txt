+ k3b is good for ripping+converting cd audio to mp3 or other formats.

+ for lossless music compression, the flac and shorten (shn) formats are
very nice.  there are some canonical tools for each platform for these.

gnome tool called 'soundconverter'.

seems to no longer be updated.

movie processing

avidemux:
if you need to manipulate a video, for example to rotate it or transcode it to a different
format, then avidemux works great.

openshot:
if you need to jam a bunch of videos together, crossfade them, and that kind of stuff,
then try openshot.  it also supports simple saving with different quality levels, which
lets you drop a bunch of size at the expense of the picture.  sometimes needed.

music collection management
---------------------------

dupeguru:
found this to be pretty helpful in finding my duplicate songs.  it is able to analyze
when the files are the same, even if their names don't match.
check: did it even compare by metadata?  not remembering currently.

fdupes:
another useful tool for finding duplicate tracks in a music collection, but relies on exact
matches in the names(?).  was not so powerful as dupeguru, but still useful.

picture collection management
-----------------------------

shotwell:
currently the top picture manipulation and manager tool i use at home.
the imaginations folder is based on the date management in shotwell.
