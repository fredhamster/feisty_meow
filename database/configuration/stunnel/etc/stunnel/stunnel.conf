; Sample stunnel configuration file by Michal Trojnara 2002-2009
; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please make sure you understand them (especially the effect of the chroot jail)

; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = /etc/ssl/certs/stunnel.pem
;key = /etc/stunnel/mail.key

; Protocol version (all, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1)
sslVersion = SSLv3

; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = /var/run/stunnel/
setuid = nobody
setgid = nobody
; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
;compression = zlib

; Workaround for Eudora bug
;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; Authentication stuff
;verify = 2
; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs
; It's often easier to use CAfile
;CAfile = /etc/stunnel/certs.pem
;CAfile = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls
; Alternatively you can use CRLfile
;CRLfile = /etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
debug = 7
output = stunnel.log

; Use it for client mode
;client = yes
