copy the included files into /etc in the same hierarchy structure, which is:

  etc/
  etc/init.d
  etc/init.d/stunnel
  etc/stunnel
  etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

fix permissions:

  chmod 755 /etc/init.d/stunnel

fix configuration:

  modify /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf to represent your desired tunneling
  configuration.  the example turns a trac install on localhost with standard
  http protocol into a TLS version on the https protocol.

run this command to get stunnel registered:

  sudo /sbin/chkconfig --add stunnel

afterwards the service should start with:

  /etc/init.d/stunnel start

if problems result from starting the service:

  + maybe you need to fix the path in the /etc/init.d/stunnel script.
    try running:
       "which stunnel"  (or "whence stunnel")
    and updating the script with the path shown for stunnel.

  + maybe there's a port conflict from another service?
    check with the configuration files or ask the system administrators for
    assistance.  the telnet tool will connect to an arbitrary tcp service and
    inform you if the connection succeeded, e.g. "telnet myhost 23230".
    if it says "Connected to ...." then the connection was successful,
    regardless of the type of tcp protocol actually on that port.  if that
    reports instead "unable to connect to remote host", then no answer was
    received.  if the telnet session just says "Trying ...." and never comes
    back or takes a really long time, then a firewall may be blocking the
    port or the machine may be down.
