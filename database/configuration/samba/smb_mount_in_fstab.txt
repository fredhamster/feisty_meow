  # in this example, a box named gulliver has an SMB share called "build".
  # we are mounting that to a local directory /home/fred/gullybuild.
  # the uid/gid items should be set to the actual user id and group id for
  # whatever user will need to access and modify those files.  the credentials
  # file is used to specify authentication parameters for the share.  an
  # example of the credential file format is below.

###############

# example credentials file:
# the information below is all that should be needed to access the share on
# gulliver.  note that the user can contain a windows domain.
# this file does not go in /etc/fstab!  it should be a separate file in the
# /etc directory or some other safe place.  the file permissions should only
# allow root to read/write the file, such as when these three commands
# are used to set the ownership and permissions:
#     chown root /etc/gulliver_credentials.txt
#     chgrp root /etc/gulliver_credentials.txt
#     chmod 600 /etc/gulliver_credentials.txt
