" cranks up the register saved buffer size to 1000 lines, since otherwise the cut buffer will only
" preserve the default 50 lines for a paste to another file.  this makes all registers go up to
" this size though, so if you save to a lot of different ones, you will use more space in your
" viminfo file.
