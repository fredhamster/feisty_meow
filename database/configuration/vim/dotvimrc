set viminfo='100,<1000,s10,h
" cranks up the register saved buffer size to 1000 lines, since otherwise the cut buffer will only
" preserve the default 50 lines for a paste to another file.  this makes all registers go up to
" this size though, so if you save to a lot of different ones, you will use more space in your
" viminfo file.

set nobk
" tells vim not to make a backup of the file before editing it; this is living dangerously.

set nocompatible
" nocompatible|nocp turns off compatibility mode, allowing filename completion.

colorscheme elflord
" elflord just happens to be the color scheme i prefer.  there are a bunch.
