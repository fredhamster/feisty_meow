When an archer is shooting for nothing
He has all his skill.
If he shoots for a brass buckle
He is already nervous.
If he shoots for a prize of gold
He goes blind
Or sees two targets--
He is out of his mind!

His skill has not changed.  But the prize
Divides him.  He cares.
He thinks more of winning
Than of shooting--
And the need to win
Drains him of power.

I forgot what the story was about, but there was a good movie
on the plane.  It was a little long though.

what was coming.

is a toy space helmet.  You show up at practice and then either steal the
ball and make us chase you to get it back, or you try to tackle people at
inappropriate times."

brewing inside the head of the coach.  He sees something inside of me,
some kind of raw talent that he can mold.  But that's when I felt the
handcuffs go on.

and in him is a little baby shark.  And in the baby shark there isn't a
person, because it would be too small.  But there's a little doll or
something, like a Johnny Combat little toy guy--something like that.

It makes me mad when I go to all the trouble of having Marta cook up about
a hundred drumsticks, then the guy at Marineland says, "You can't throw
chicken to the dolphins.  They eat fish."  Sure they eat fish, if that is all
you give them.  Man, wise up.

If I lived back in the Wild West days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my
holster, I'd carry a soldering iron.  That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy
said something like "Hey, look.  He's carrying a soldering iron!" and started
laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, "That's
right, it's a soldering iron.  The soldering iron of justice."  Then everybody
would be real quiet and ashamed, because they made fun of the soldering iron
of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink.

If you're a circus clown, and you have a dog that you use in your act, I

Maybe in order to understand mankind, we have to look at the word itself:

The smell of something was strong in the air as we played whatever sport we
played.  I remember a bigger, older guy we called "Dad."  We'd eat some stuff,
or not, and then I think we went home.  I guess some things never leave you.

Another major social development of the time was the Temperance
Movement, led by Carrie Nation, who headed an organization called
Scary Looking Women with Hatchets.  They would swoop down upon saloons
and smash all the whiskey bottles, then go back to their headquarters,
fire up reefers as big as Roman candles, and laugh until dawn.  This
resulted in so much social turmoil that in 1918 Congress decided to
have a total prohibition on alcohol, which was approved early on a
Saturday morning by a vote of 9-2, with 416 members unable to attend
because of severe headaches.  Thus began the nation's "Noble
Experiment," which was eventually judged to be a noble failure and
replaced by the current sensible and coherent alcohol policy of
showing public-service TV announcements wherein professional sports
figures urge people not to drink, interspersed with TV commercials
wherein professional sports figures urge people to drink.
  -- from "Dave Barry Slept Here", 1989

1.  Tao

The Tao that can be known is not Tao.
The substance of the World is only a name for Tao.
Tao is all that exists and may exist;
The World is only a map of what exists and may exist.

One experiences without Self to sense the World;
One experiences with Self to understand the World.
The two experiences are the same within Tao;
They are distinct only within the World.
Neither experience conveys Tao
Which is infinitely greater and subtler than the World.
~
2. Qualities

When Beauty is ascribed to the World
Ugliness has been learned;
When Good is ascribed to the World
Evil has been learned.

In this way:
Alive and dead are abstracted from growth;
Difficult and easy are abstracted from progress;
Long and short are abstracted from contrast;
High and low are abstracted from position;
Song and speech are abstracted from harmony;
After and before are abstracted from sequence.

For this reason the sage controls without instruction,
And teaches without words.
He lets all things rise and fall,
Nurtures, but does not interfere,
Gives without demanding,
And is content.
~
3. Control without Action

Not praising the worthy prevents cheating
Not esteeming the rare prevents theft
Not flaunting beauty prevents lust

So the sage controls people by:
Emptying their hearts,
Filling their bellies,
Weakening their ambitions,
And strengthening their bodies.

If people lack knowledge and desire
The crafty among them can not act;
If no action is taken
Then all live in peace.
~
4. Properties of Tao

Tao is a depthless vessel;
Used by the Self, it is not filled by the World;
It cannot be cut, knotted, dimmed or stilled;
Its depths are hidden, ubiquitous and eternal;
I don't know where it came from,
But it came before Nature.
~
5. Nature

Nature is not kind;
It treats all things impartially.
The Sage is not kind,
And treats all people impartially.

Nature is like a bellows
Empty, yet supplying all needs,
The more it moves, the more it yields;
The sage draws upon Tao in the same way
And so can not be exhausted.
~
6. Heart

Like a riverbed, the heart is never filled
It is an ineffable female
Whose entrance is the root of the World;
Tao is ever present within it:
Draw upon it and it will never fail.
~
7. Self

Nature is everlasting
Because it does not have a Self.

In the same way the sage
Serves his Self last and finds it served first,
Regards his body as accidental and finds it endures;
Because his Self does not require service
He is content.
~
8. Intimacy

The best of man is like water,
Which benefits all things, and does not contend with them,
Which flows in places that others disdain,
Where it holds fast to Tao.

So the sage:
In dwelling holds fast to the land,
In feeling holds fast to the heart,
In dealing holds fast to men,
In talking holds fast to truth,
In governing holds fast to order,
In crafting holds fast to competence,
In acting holds fast to opportunity;
So he does not contend, and is without blame.
~
9. Hubris

Stretch a bow to its limit and it is soon broken;
Temper a blade to its sharpest and it is soon blunted;
Amass the greatest treasure and it is soon stolen;
Claim credit and honour and you will soon fall;
Retire once your purpose is achieved--this is the best way.
~
10. Love

Embracing Tao, can you become embraced?
Supple, breathing gently, can you become newborn?
Clearing your vision, can you become clear?
Nurturing your beloved, can you become impartial?
Opening your heart, can you become female?
Knowing the world, can you embrace Tao?

Bearing and nurturing,
Creating but not owning,
Giving without demanding,
Controlling without authority.
This is love.
~
11. Wealth and Worth

Thirty spokes meet at a nave;
Because of the hole we may use the wheel.
Clay is moulded into a vessel;
Because of the hollow we may use the cup.
Walls are built around a hearth
Because of the doors we may use the house.
Thus wealth comes from what is,
But worth from what is not.
~
12. Distraction

Too much color blinds the eye
Too much tone deafens the ear
Too much taste dulls the palate
Too much play maddens the mind
Too much desire tears the heart.

The sage provides for the belly but not for the senses;
He lets go of sensation and accepts substance.
~
13. Anxiety

The mythic masters said: "Praise and blame cause anxiety;
The objects of hope and fear are within your Self."

"Praise and blame cause anxiety"
For you must hope and fear to receive or to lose them.

"The objects of hope and fear are within your Self"
For, without Self, neither fortune nor disaster can befall.

Therefore:
He who regards the World as the Self is able to control the World;
He who loves the World as the Self is able to nurture the World.
~
14. The Continuity of Tao

Looked at but cannot be seen--it is beyond form;
Listened to but cannot be heard--it is beyond sound;
Grasped at but cannot be touched--it is beyond reach;
Depthless things evade definition,
And blend into a single mystery.

In its rising there is no light,
In its falling there is no darkness,
A continuous thread beyond description,
Lining what can not exist,
Its form formless,
Its image nothing,
Its name mystery,
Meet it, it has no face,
Follow it, it has no back.

Understand the past, but attend the present;
In this way you know the continuity of Tao,
Which is its essence.
~
15. The Mythic Masters

The Mythic Masters of Tao had understanding
So profound they can not be understood.

Because they cannot be understood
I can only describe their appearance:
Cautious, like one crossing thin ice,
Hesitant, like one who fears danger,
Modest, like one who is a guest,
Smooth, like melting ice,
Genuine, like unshaped wood,
Empty, like a riverbed,
Opaque, like muddy water.

He who can lie still while the mud settles,
And remain still until the water flows
Does not seek fulfillment
And may transcend Nature.
~
16. Transcending Nature

Empty the Self completely;
Embrace perfect peace.
The World will rise and move;
Watch it return to rest.
All the flourishing things
Will return to their source.

This return is peaceful;
It is the way of Nature,
An eternal decay and renewal.
Understanding this brings enlightenment,
Ignorance of this brings misery.

Who understands Nature's way becomes all-cherishing;
Being all-cherishing he becomes impartial;
Being impartial he becomes magnanimous;
Being magnanimous he becomes part of Nature;
Being part of Nature he becomes one with Tao;
Being one with Tao he becomes immortal:
Though his body will decay, Tao will not.
~
17. Rulers

The best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;
The next best are loved and praised;
The next are feared;
The next despised:
They have no faith in their subjects,
So their subjects become unfaithful to them.

When the best kings achieve their purpose
Their subjects claim the achievement as their own.
~
18. Loss of Tao

When Tao is forgotten
Duty and justice arise;
Then wisdom and sagacity are born
Along with hypocrisy.

When family relationships dissolve
Then respect and devotion arise;
When a nation falls to chaos
Then loyalty and patriotism are born.
~
19. Simplicity

If we could discard wisdom and sagacity
Then people would profit a hundredfold;
If we could discard duty and justice
Then loving relationships would form;
If we could discard artifice and profit
Then corruption and theft would disappear -
Yet such remedies treat only symptoms
And so are inadequate.

People need personal remedies:
Reveal your naked Self,
Embrace your original nature,
Bind your self-interest,
Control your desire.
~
20. Loneliness

I know nothing and nothing troubles me.
I see no difference between yes and no.
I see no difference between good and evil.
I do not fear what the people fear in the night.

The people are merry as if at a tremendous party
Or playing in the park at springtime;
But I am tranquil and wandering,
Like a newborn before it learns to smile,
Lonely, with no true home.

The people have enough and to spare,
But I have nothing,
And my heart is foolish,
Muddled and cloudy.

The people are bright and certain,
Where I am dim and confused;
The people are clever and wise,
Where I am dull and ignorant,
Aimless as a wave drifting over the sea,
Attached to nothing.

The people are busy with purpose,
Where I am impractical and uncouth.
I am apart from all other people
Yet I am sustained by Nature, their mother.
~
21. Expressions of Tao

Love is expressed by following Tao.

Tao is evasive and intangible
But expresses all form and substance;
Tao is dark and subtle
But expresses Nature;
Nature is unchanging,
But expresses sensation.

Since before knowledge
Tao has expressed these things.
How do I know?
By faith in my senses.
~
22. Contention and Contentment

Accept and you become whole,
Bend and you straighten,
Empty and you fill,
Decay and you renew,
Want and you acquire,
Fulfill and you become confused.

The sage embraces the one
As the World embraces Tao;
He does not display himself, so is clearly seen,
Does not justify himself, so is famed,
Does not boast, so is credited,
Does not glory, so excels,
Does not contend, and so no one contends against him.

The mythic masters said, "Accept and you become whole",
Once whole, the World is your home.
~
23. Talk and Trust

Nature says only a few words:
High wind does not last long,
Nor does heavy rain.
If Nature's words do not last
Why should those of man?

To follow Tao, become Tao; Tao will embrace you.
To give love, become love; love will embrace you.
To lose Tao, become lost; loss will embrace you.
You must trust in order to be trusted.
~
24. Tumors

If you stand on tiptoe you can not stand steady;
If you stride too long you can not stride well;
If you display yourself you can not be clearly seen;
If you justify yourself you can not be respected;
If you promote yourself you can not be believed;
If you pride yourself you can not excel.
These behaviours are dregs and tumors,
Disgusting things avoided by love.
~
25. Four Infinities.

Before the World exists
There is mystery:
Silent, depthless,
Alone, unchanging,
Ubiquitous and ever moving,
The mother of the World.
I can not know its name, so I call it Tao;
I can not know its limit, so I call it infinite.

Being infinite, it flows away forever
Flowing away forever, it will return to the Self.

For the Self follows the way of the World
The World follows the way of Nature
And Nature follows the way of Tao.
Tao is its own way.

Tao is infinite,
Therefore Nature is infinite,
Therefore the World is infinite,
Therefore the Self is infinite.
There are four infinities,
And the Self is one of them.
~
26. Gravity and Calm

Gravity is the root of Lightness,
Calm, the master of Haste

The commander of a great fleet should not act lightly or hastily.
Acting lightly, he loses touch with the World,
Acting hastily, he loses control of the Self.

The sage will travel all day without losing his vehicles.
Surrounded by desirable things,
He remains calm and unattached.
~
27. Attention

A good traveller leaves no trail to be followed
A good speaker leaves no questions to be asked
A good accountant leaves no workings to be checked
A good container leaves no lock to be opened
A good fastener leaves no knots to be unravelled

So the sage nurtures all men
And abandons no one.
He accepts everything
And rejects nothing.
He attends to the smallest details.

So the strong must guide the weak,
For the weak are raw material to the strong.
If the guide is not respected
Or the material is not nurtured
Confusion will result, no matter how clever one is.
This is the essence of subtlety.
~
28. Being the Female

Knowing the male, being the female,
Being the course through which flows the World,
One possesses unfailing Love
And exists again as a newborn.

Knowing the light, being the dark,
Being the World,
One becomes unerring Love
And returns to Tao.

Knowing honour, being humble,
Being the valley of the World,
Love suffices,
And one becomes as unshaped wood.

When wood is shaped it becomes tools.
Used by the sage, tools become powerful;
A good carpenter wastes little.
~
29. Blindness

Those who wish to change the World
According with their desire
Cannot succeed.

The World is shaped by Tao;
It cannot be shaped by the Self.
If one tries to shape it, one damages it;
If one tries to possess it, one loses it.

So:
Sometimes things will flourish,
And sometimes they will not.
Sometimes life is hard
And sometimes it is easy.
Sometimes people are strong
And sometimes they are weak.
Sometimes you get where you are going
And sometimes you fall by the way.

The sage is never extreme, extravagant, or complacent.
~
30. Violence

Powerful men are well advised not to use violence,
For violence has a habit of returning;
Thorns and weeds grow wherever an army goes,
And lean years follow a great war.

A general is well advised
To achieve nothing more than his orders,
No matter how strong his army;
To carry out his orders
But not glory, boast or be proud;
To do what is dictated by necessity,
But not by bloodlust;
For even the fiercest force will weaken with time,
And then its violence will return, and kill it.
~
31. Tools of Violence

Soldiers are tools of violence, feared by all;
The sage will not employ them.
His purpose is creation;
Their purpose is destruction.

Weapons are tools of violence, not of the wise man;
He uses them when there is no choice
For he values peace and tact,
And does not delight in conquest.

For who delights in conquest
Delights in the slaughter of men;
Who delights in the slaughter of men
Cannot control them.

Slaughters should be mourned
And conquest should be celebrated with a funeral.
~
32. Shape

Tao has no true definition.
Like unshaped wood, it has no use;
If a ruler understands this
His whole country flourishes and obeys
In harmony with his Self,
Just as sweet rain falls
Needing no instruction
To slake the thirst of all.

When Tao is shaped by use,
The shape gains a name in the World;
One should not keep too many names
Lest their shapes stop up the Self;
Instead let Tao flow through the Self into the World
As water courses down a riverbed into the sea.
~
33. Virtues

He who understands the World is learned;
He who understands the Self is enlightened.
He who conquers the World has strength;
He who conquers the Self has love.
He who is contented has riches;
He who is determined has purpose.
He who maintains his home will long endure
He who maintains his influence will live long after death.
~
34. Tao Favours Nothing

Infinite Tao flows everywhere, creating and destroying,
Implementing all the World, attending to the tiniest details,
Claiming nothing in return.

It nurtures all things,
Though it does not control them;
It has no intention
So it seems inconsequential.

It is the substance of all things;
Though it does not control them;
It has no exception
So it seems all-important.

Because it favours no finite thing,
It is infinite.
~
35. Peace

Tao lacks art and flavour;
It can neither be seen nor heard,
Yet its application cannot be exhausted.

So, if you offer music and food
Strangers may stop with you;
But if you accord with the shape of Tao
The people of the World will keep you
In safety, health, community, and peace.
~
36. Playing Poker

To reduce someone's influence, first cause it to expand;
To reduce someone's force, first cause it to increase;
To overthrow someone, first cause them to be exalted;
To take something from someone, first give it to them.

This is the subtlety by which the weak overcome the strong,
For fish should not leave their depths;
And soldiers should not leave their camouflage.
~
37. Quieting the Heart

Tao does not act, yet leaves nothing undone.
If the Self understands this
All things of the World will naturally flourish;
Flourishing, they will be restrained by Nature.

Nature does not possess desire;
Without desire, the heart becomes quiet,
And so the whole World may be made tranquil.
~
38. Religion

The kind act without self-interest;
The just act to serve self-interest;
The religious act to reproduce self-interest.

When Tao is lost, there is love;
When love is lost, there is kindness;
When kindness is lost, there is justice;
And when justice is lost, there is religion.

Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;
Closely held beliefs are not easily released;
So religions enthrall generation after generation.

Religion is the dissolution of love and trust,
The beginning of confusion.
Belief is a colourful hope or fear,
The origin of folly.

The sage goes by knowledge, not by hope;
He dwells in the fruit, not the flower;
He accepts the former, and rejects the latter.
~
39. Wholeness

In mythic times things were whole:
All the sky was clear,
All the earth was stable,
All the mountains were strong,
All the riverbeds were full,
All of nature was alive,
All the rulers were supported.

For without clarity the sky tears;
Without stability the earth cracks;
Without strength the mountain collapses;
Without water the riverbed stagnates;
Without life nature dies back;
And without support rulers fall.

So the ruler depends upon his subjects,
The noble depend upon the humble;
Rulers call themselves orphaned, lonely or disabled,
To win the people's sympathy,
For wholeness gains no support.

So there is weakness in power,
And power in weakness;
Rather than tinkle like jade,
One should clatter like stones.
~
40. Application of Tao

The motion of Tao is to return;
The use of Tao is to accept;
All things are made of Tao,
And Tao is made of nothing.
~
41. Taoism

When the strong learn Tao, they practice it diligently;
When the average learn Tao, they practice it sometimes;
When the weak learn Tao, they laugh out loud;
Those who do not laugh do not learn at all.

Therefore is it said:
Who understands Tao seems foolish;
Who progresses in Tao seems to fail;
Who follows Tao seems to wander.

For the greatest force appears vulnerable;
The brightest truth appears coloured;
The richest character appears incomplete;
The strongest heart appears meek;
The most beautiful nature appears fickle;

For the square, perfected, has no corner;
Art, perfected, has no meaning;
Sex, perfected, has no climax;
Form, perfected, has no shape.

So Tao can not be sensed or known:
It transmits sensation and transcends knowledge.
~
42. Harmony

Tao bears love;
Love bears restraint;
Restraint bears acceptance;
Acceptance bears the World;
All things begin with love and end with restraint,
But it is acceptance that brings harmony.

As others teach, I teach:
"Those without harmony end with violence";
This is my teacher.
~
43. Overcoming the Impossible

The soft overcomes the hard;
The formless penetrates the impenetrable;
Therefore I value taking no action.

Teaching without words,
Work without action,
Are understood by no one.
~
44. Contentment

Fame or Self: which is dearer?
Self or wealth: which is more valuable?
Profit or loss: which is more torturous?

Great love incurs great expense,
And great wealth incurs great theft,
But great contentment incurs no loss.

Therefore:
He who knows when to stop
Does not continue into danger,
And may long endure.
~
45. Quiet

Great perfection seems imperfect,
But does not decay;
Great abundance seems empty,
But does not fail.

Great truth seems contradictory;
Great cleverness seems stupid;
Great eloquence seems awkward.

Action overcomes contentment,
But stillness overcomes desire;
Therefore calm and quiet control the World.
~
46. Desire

When the World is not in accord with Tao,
Horses bear soldiers through the countryside;
When the World is in accord with Tao,
Horses bear horse-manure through the countryside.

There is no greater curse than desire;
There is no greater misery than discontent;
There is no greater ailment than greed;
He who is content to be content shall always be content.
~
47. Knowledge and Experience

Without taking a step outdoors
You know the whole World.
Without taking a look out the window
You see the colour of the sky.

The more you experience,
The less you know.
The sage wanders without knowing,
Looks without seeing,
Accomplishes without acting.
~
48. Knowledge

The follower of knowledge acquires as much as he can every day;
The follower of Tao loses as much as he can every day.

By attrition he reaches a state of inaction
Wherein he does nothing, but leaves nothing undone.

To conquer the world, do nothing;
If you must do something,
The world remains beyond conquest.
~
49. The Worlds of Others

The sage does not distinguish between Self and World;
Therefore the needs of people in the World are as his own.

He is good to those who are good;
He is also good to those who are not good;
For love is goodness.
He trusts those who are trustworthy;
He also trusts those who are not trustworthy;
For love is trust.

He is in harmony with the World;
Therefore he nurtures the Worlds of others
As a mother does her children.
~
50. Life and Death

Death enters life as man enters woman.

The limits of man:
Thirty years of growth;
Thirty years of decay;
Thirty years inbetween;
So death and life reproduce themselves.

He who would prolong his life
Will not meet tigers or rhinoceri in the wilds,
Nor soldiers in battle
So the rhinoceros sees no place in him for its horn,
The tiger no place for its claw,
The soldier no place for a weapon;
So death finds no place to enter his life.
~
51. Love

Tao bears us,
Love nurtures us,
Nature shapes us,
Circumstance completes us.

We worship Tao and honour love;
For worship of Tao and honour of love
Are performed just by being alive.

Tao bears us,
Love nurtures, develops, cares for,
Shelters, comforts and makes a home for us.

Making without controlling,
Giving without demanding,
Guiding without interfering,
Helping without profiting,
This is love.
~
52. Restraint

The origins of the World are its mother;
Know the mother, and you understand the child;
Know the child, and you embrace the mother,
Who will not perish when you die.

Reserve your judgments and words
And you maintain your influence;
Draw conclusions and speak your mind
And your cause is lost.

As seeing detail is clarity,
So maintaining tact is strength;
Keep your eyes and mind open
So that you may not regret your actions;
This is restraint.
~
53. Distractions

With but a small understanding
One may follow Tao like a main road,
Fearing only to leave it;
Following a main road is easy,
But being sidetracked is also easy.

For when palaces are kept up
Fields are left to weeds
And granaries empty.

Wearing fine clothes,
Bearing sharp swords,
Glutting with food and drink,
Hoarding wealth and possessions -
These are the ways of theft
And deviations from Tao.
~
54.  Go by Love

Love does not think of love
For this reason is it strong;
It does not act,
Yet leaves nothing undone.
Desire is intent upon love
For this reason is it weak;
It always acts,
Yet gets nothing done.

Nurture love in the Self, and love will be genuine;
Nurture love in the family, and love will be abundant;
Nurture love in the community, and love will multiply;
Nurture love in the culture, and love will flourish;
Nurture love in the World, and love will be ubiquitous.

Therefore:
Judge a person by their love;
Judge a family by its love;
Judge a community by its love;
Judge a culture by its love;
Judge the World by its love.
How can I know the love of the World?
By judging my Self.
~
55. Love and Nature

Who is filled with love is like a newborn.
Wasps will not sting him;
Tigers will not eat him;
Hawks will not tear out his eyes.

His bones are soft, yet his sinews are supple,
So his grip is strong;
He has no wife, yet his manhood is healthy,
So his vigour is unspoiled;
He sings all day yet his voice remains sweet
So his harmony is perfect.

To approach Nature is to know harmony;
To achieve Nature is to be enlightened;
But to surpass Nature invites calamity
For emotion will burst the lungs
And exhaustion will age the heart:
The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.
~
56. Impartiality.

He who knows does not speak;
He who speaks does not know.

Reserve your judgments and words;
Dull your wit and simplify your purpose;
Be humble as earth and a part of Nature.

In this way
Friendship and enmity,
Profit and loss,
Honour and disgrace,
Will not affect you.
The impartial Self is of most benefit to the World.
~
57. Government

A nation is best governed by innocence;
A war is best waged by treachery;
The World is best controlled by inaction;
How do I know?

Because:
The more property and taxes there are,
The more poverty prevails;
The more guns and knives there are,
The more chaos prevails;
The more arts and sciences there are,
The more deceit prevails;
The more rules and regulations there are,
The more theft prevails.

Therefore the sage says:
I take no action, and the people become civilized;
I wage no war, and the people become just;
I transact no business, and the people become wealthy;
I have no desire, and the people become innocent.
~
58. Be Forgiving

When government is lazy and blunt
The people are kind and honest;
When government is efficient and severe
The people are discontented and deceitful.

Misery may yield happiness;
Happiness may conceal misery.
Who can say which will be for the best?
Nothing is straightforward.
Honesty is ever corrupted;
Kindness is ever seduced;
Men have been like this for a long time.

So the sage is firm but not cutting,
Pointed but not piercing,
Straight but not inflexible,
Brilliant but not blinding.
~
59. Restraint

Manage a great nation
As you would cook a delicate fish.

When directing men to a purpose
The sage is restrained;
Restraint allows time to prepare and strengthen,
To build loving relationships;
With sufficient strength and love all resistance is overcome;
When all resistance is overcome his purpose is achieved.

Who can achieve his purpose is able to direct men
And his influence upon them long endures.
Deeply rooted and firmly established,
His vision lives on even after death.
~
60. Emotions

Because the sage follows Tao his emotions do no hurt;
It is not that they lose their power;
But that they do not hurt others;
Because they do not hurt others,
He does not hurt others:
Because his emotions do no hurt,
His relations with people are loving.
~
61. International Relations

A nation acts as a hierarchy, a meeting place, and a female.
A female seduces a male by being cool,
Being cool is a means of submission.

If a large country submits to a small country
It will seduce the small country;
If a small country submits to a large country
It will seduce the large country;
The large will submit in order to control
And the small will submit in order to prosper.

Therefore:
It is in the interests of a large country to give shelter,
And in the interests of a small country to give service;
If both would achieve their purposes,
Both must submit.
~
62.  Sin

Tao is the source of all things,
The treasure of the saint,
And the refuge of the sinner.

Fine words win honour
And fine acts win respect,
But if a man sins, do not abandon him;
And if a man wins power, do not bribe him;
Just be still and present accordance with Tao.

Why do saints treasure Tao?
Because it is easily found by seeking,
And absolves every sin.
It is the most valuable gift.
~
63. Confront Difficulty

Practise no-action;
Attend to do-nothing;
Taste the flavorless,
Attend the small,
Multiply the few,
Return love for hate.

Deal with difficulty while it is yet easy;
Deal with the great while it is yet small;

The difficult develops naturally from the easy
And the great from the small;
So the sage, by dealing with the small
Achieves the great.

He who finds it easy to promise finds it hard to deliver;
He who takes things lightly makes things hard;
The sage confronts difficulty, and so has none.
~
64. Care at Beginning and End

What lies still is easy to grasp;
What is far off is easy to plan for;
What is cold is easy to shatter;
What is small is easy to disperse.

Yet
A tree broader than a man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;
A dam taller than a river can overflow is born of a clod of earth;
A journey of a thousand miles begins at the spot under one's feet.

Therefore deal with things before they happen;
Create order before there is confusion.

Yet he who acts, spoils;
He who grasps, loses.
People often fail on the verge of success.
Take care at the end as at the beginning,
So that you may avoid failure.

The sage desires no desire,
Values no valuable,
Knows no knowledge,
But gives the people what they can not find
And helps all things accord with Nature
Without interfering.
~
65. Understanding History

The mythic masters of Tao did not want to make people wise,
But to keep them ignorant;
For it is difficult to govern people who know too much.

To govern a nation by imparting knowledge to its people
Destroys the nation.
To govern a nation by decreasing the knowledge of its people
Serves the nation.

Understanding these two paths is understanding history;
Understanding history gives clarity of vision
By which one may see through deceit.
~
66. Lead by Following

How does the river carve out the valley?
By flowing beneath it.
Thereby the river is master of the valley.

In order to master people
One must speak as their servant;
So when the sage is elevated to power
People do not feel oppressed.

In order to lead people
One must follow them;
So when the sage restrains people
They do not feel hindered.

Thus the popularity of the sage does not fail,
He does not seem superior, so no one wishes to usurp him.
~
67. Three Treasures

It may seem that my teaching means nothing;
It describes the infinite, so of course it means nothing;
If it meant something it would long since have been refuted.

Yet I have three treasures, which I follow and commend to you:
The first is love.
By which one finds courage.
The second is restraint.
By which one finds strength.
The third is not contending.
By which one finds influence.

Those who are fearless, but without love,
Strong, but without restraint,
Or influential, yet contentious,
Are doomed.

Only love conquers all and is defeated by none.
It is Nature's finest tool and sharpest weapon.
~
68. Using Men

A good soldier does not use violence;
A good fighter does not use anger;
A good conqueror does not use attack;
A good ruler does not use authority;
So not contending is the best way to use men.
~
69. Ambush

There is a saying among soldiers:
It is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.

In this way one may deploy troops without marshalling them,
Reveal weapons without exposing them,
Assault the foe without charging them,
And apply force without aggression.

Conversely there is no disaster like underestimating your enemy;
For false confidence will lose you your most valued assets.
When two equally matched forces meet
The general who conserves life will win.
~
70. Individuality

My words are easy to understand
And my actions are easy to perform
Yet no man can understand or perform them.

My words have logic; my actions have meaning;
Yet these cannot be known and I cannot be known.

We are each unique; no man understands another.
Though the sage wears coarse clothes, his heart is jade.
~
71. Sickness

Who knows what he knows is healthy;
Who ignores what he ignores is sick;
Who grows sick of sickness recovers;
The sage is never sick, but always sick of sickness.
~
72. Friendship

When people do not fear, they are easily conquered.

Praise their goods and children
And they will not dislike yours.
Know your superiority,
But do not tell it to them;
Love your home,
But do not let them know;
Reject what is yours
And accept what is theirs.
~
73. Fate

Who is brave and bold may die;
Who is brave and subtle may live.
Which course best serves one's purpose?
Fate favours some and destroys others.
The sage does not know why.

Fate does not contend, yet all things are conquered by it;
It does not ask, yet all things answer to it;
It does not call, yet all things come to it;
It does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.

Fate's hands are vast, its fingers spread wide,
Yet none slip through its grasp.
~
74. Tyranny

People do not fear death, so do not threaten them with death.

If people feared death, and you executed all who did not love you
There would be no people left but you and the executioner.
You would then need to kill him.
You would then need to chop off your own hand.
~
75. Extremis

If rulers take too much grain
People rapidly starve;
If rulers take too much freedom
People easily rebel;
If rulers take too much happiness.
People gladly die.

By not interfering the sage improves the people's lives.
~
76. Flexibility

Man is born soft and tender,
But dies hard and stiff.
Plants and animals, in life, are supple and juicy;
In death, brittle and dry.
So hardness and stiffness are attributes of death,
And softness and tenderness attributes of life.

Just as a sapless tree splits and decays
A strong but inflexible force will meet defeat;
So the hard and mighty lie beneath our feet
While the tender and weak toss in the breeze above.
~
77. Balance

Is the movement of Nature not unlike drawing a bow?
What is higher descends and what is lower ascends;
What is longer shortens and what is shorter lengthens;
Nature's way decreases those who have more than they need
So to increase those who need more than they have.

It is not so with Man.
Man decreases those who need more than they have
So to increase those who have more than they need.

The sage works regardless of personal reward or recognition;
To benefit the World is to benefit the Self.
~
78. Accept Responsibility

Nothing in the World is as yielding as water;
Nor can anything better overcome the hardened.

Just as the yielding overcomes the hardened,
The weak may overcome the strong;
Yet they do not.

For the sage says:
"Who accepts responsibility for his people rules the country;
Who accepts responsibility for the World rules the World"
Yet his words are not understood.
~
79. Reconciliation

When conflict is reconciled, some hatred remains;
How can this be put right?

The sage accepts less than is due
And does not blame or punish;
Love seeks agreement
Where justice seeks payment.

The mythic masters said: "Nature is impartial;
Therefore it serves those who serve all."
~
80. Utopia

Imagine that there is a small country with few people;
Who have a hundred times more than they need;
Who love life and do not wander far;
Who own ships but do no foreign trade;
Who own weapons but do not threaten war;
Who are literate but keep no histories;
Who cook well, dress beautifully, dwell safely
And delight in their own culture,
But live within cock crow of their neighbours.

People in such a place would never leave.
~
81. The Sage

Truth is not rhetorical;
Therefore rhetoric is not true;
Lovers do not contend;
Therefore competitors do not love;
The enlightened keep no knowledge;
Therefore the learned are not enlightened.

The sage does not aim to increase himself;
But the more he does for others the more he is satisfied;
And the more he gives the more he gets.

The best way is to benefit all and harm none;
So the sage achieves his purpose without contention.

Minds are like parachutes, they only function when they're open.

[Reuters 8/16/92] SHANGHAI--A 24-year-old bus passenger, Dong Huibo, died
in the street, after tangling with one of the city's dreaded woman bus
conductors.   His nightmare began inside the bus when the ticketpuncher
snarled an insult about the shape of his backside.   She swore at him,
slapped his face and broke his glasses, made a grab for his testicles, then
stood back and aimed a vicious kick at his private parts.  As he scrambled
out of a window, the driver--also a woman--slammed her foot on the
accelerator pedal and sent him flying. (From: Di Bi Cao)

HSIN-HSIN-MING (AFFIRMING FAITH IN MIND)

wong@rkna50.riken.go.jp (Wong Weng Fai) posted a version of this,
and I thought I would send another, longer version. This is from
(if my memory serves) Roshi Kapleau's "Zen--Dawn in the West",
so I assume it is his translation.
~
The Great Way is not difficult
For those who do not pick and choose.
~
When preferences are cast aside
The Way stands clear and undisguised.
~
But even slight distinctions made
Set Heaven and Earth far apart.
~
If you would clearly see the truth,
Discard opinions pro and con.
~
To founder in like and dislike
Is nothing but the mind's disease.
~
And not to see the Way's deep truth
Disturbs the Mind's essential peace.
~
The Way is perfect like vast space,
Where there's no lack and no excess.
~
Our choice to choose and to reject
Prevents our seeing this simple truth.
~
Both striving for the outer world
As well as for the inner void
Condemns us to entangled lives.
~
Just calmly see that all is One
And by themselves false views will go.
~
Attempts to stop activity
Only fill you with activity.
~
Remaining in duality
You'll never know of unity.
~
And not to know this unity
Lets conflict lead you far astray.
~
When you assert that things are real,
You miss their true reality.
But to assert that things are void
Also misses reality.
~
The more you talk and think on this,
The further from the truth you'll be.
~
Cut off all useless thoughts and words
And there's nowhere you cannot go.
Returning to the root itself,
You'll find the meaning of all things.
~
If you pursue appearances,
You overlook the primal source.
~
Awakening is to go beyond
Both emptiness as well as form.
~
All changes in this empty world
Seem real because of ignorance.
~
Do not go searching for the truth,
Just let those fond opinions go.
~
Abide not in duality;
Refrain from all pursuit of it.
~
If there's a trace of right and wrong,
True Mind is lost, confused, distraught.
~
From One-Mind comes duality,
But cling not even to this one.
~
When this One-Mind rests undisturbed,
Then nothing in the world offends.
~
And when nothing can give offense,
Then all obstructions cease to be.
~
If all thought-objects disappear,
The thinking subject drops away.
~
For things are things because of mind,
As mind is mind because of things.
~
These two are merely relative,
And both at source are emptiness.
~
In emptiness these are not two,
Yet in each are contained all forms.
~
Once coarse and fine are seen no more,
Then how can there be taking sides?
~
The Great Way is without limit,
Beyond the easy and the hard.
~
But those who hold to narrow views
Are fearful and irresolute;
Their frantic haste just slows them down.
~
If you're attached to anything,
You surely will go far astray.
~
Just let go now of clinging mind,
And all things are just as they are.
In essence nothing goes or stays.
~
See into the true self of things,
And you're in step with the Great Way,
Thus walking freely and undisturbed.
~
But live in bondage to your thoughts,
And you will be confused, unclear.
~
This heavy burden weighs you down-
O why keep judging good and bad?
~
If you would walk the highest way,
Do not reject the sense domain.
~
For as it is, whole and complete,
This sense world is enlightenment.
~
The wise do not strive after goals,
But fools themselves in bondage put.
~
The One Way knows no differences;
The foolish cling to this and that.
To seek Great Mind with thinking mind
Is certainly a grave mistake.
~
From small mind comes rest and unrest,
But mind awakened transcends both.
~
Delusion spawns dualities-
These dreams are naught but flowers of air-
Why work so hard at grasping them?
~
Both gain and loss, and right and wrong-
Once and for all get rid of them.
~
When you are no longer asleep,
All dreams will vanish by themselves.
~
If mind does not discriminate,
All things are as they are, as one.
~
To go to this mysterious source
Frees us from all entanglements.
~
When all is seen with "equal mind",
To our self-nature we return.
~
This single mind goes right beyond
All reasons and comparisons.
~
Stop movement and there's no movement,
Stop rest and no-rest comes instead.
~
When rest and no-rest cease to be,
Then even Oneness disappears.
This ultimate Finality's
Beyond all laws; can't be described.
~
With single mind one with the Way,
All ego-centered strivings cease.
~
Doubts and confusion disappear,
And so true faith pervades our life.
~
There is no thing that clings to us,
And nothing that is left behind.
~
All's self-revealing, void and clear,
Without exerting power of mind.
~
Thought cannot reach this state of truth;
Here feelings are of no avail.
~
In this true world of emptiness,
Both self and other are no more.
~
To enter this true empty world,
Immediately affirm "Not-Two".
~
In this "Not-Two" all is the same,
With nothing separate or outside.
~
The wise in all times and places
Awaken to this primal truth.
~
The Way's beyond all space, all time;
One instant is ten thousand years.
~
Not only here, not only there,
Truth's right before your very eyes.
~
Distinctions such as large and small
Have relevance for you no more.
~
The largest is the smallest too-
Here limitations have no place.
~
What is is not, what is not is-
If this is not yet clear to you,
You're still far from the inner truth.
~
One thing is all, all things are one.
Know this and all's whole and complete.
~
When faith and mind are not separate,
And not separate are mind and faith,
This is beyond all words, all thought.
~
For here there is
    no yesterday,
    no tomorrow,
    no today.
~

the first differentiation between reality as conceived and reality as it IS
consists of an analogy: conceptions of reality (all ideas entertained by a
knower) are maps, while reality is the territory being mapped.
whether or not two individuals can be said to live in the same territory
is unclear, because their conceptions may be different enough that their maps
of reality are very different.  it is also unclear whether there can be said
to be two individuals at all--if the self and other are one, then all
distinctions between selves ultimately disappear in the final analysis.

When they came for the Second Amendment I didn't say anything
  because I didn't own a gun.
When they came for the Fifth and Sixth Amendments I didn't say anything
  because I had committed no crimes.
When they came for the First Amendment I couldn't say anything.

how the oceans that covered the world were perturbed,
by the tides from the orbiting moon overhead,
"How relaxing the sound of the waves is," you said.
I began to expound upon tidal effects,

so I did not explain why the sunset turns red,

                         Ode to Spot
Felis catus,                            Your visual, olfactory,
is your taxonomic nomenclature,         and auditory senses,
an endothermic quadruped,               contribute to your hunting skills,
carnivorous by nature?                  and natural defenses.

I find myself intrigued                 A tail is quite essential
by your subvocal oscillations,          for your acrobatic talents,
a singular development                  you would not be so agile,
of cat communications,                  if you lacked its counterbalance,
that obviates your basic                and when not being utilized,
hedonistic predilection,                to aid in locomotion,
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur     it often serves to illustrate,
to demonstrate affection.               the state of your emotion.

        Oh Spot, the complex levels of behavior you display,
        connote a fairly well developed cognitive array,
        and though you are not sentient, Spot,
        and do not comprehend, I nonetheless consider you
        a true and valued friend.

There is no secret to excel in playing the shakuhachi.
Blow not intensely, but from your heart.
Although technique is secondary, it helps to express your true self.
If we are natural, we make fine sound.
If we have an open mind, our sound will be mellow.
If we have right attitudes toward life,
our music will be acceptable to everyone.
Take care of your sound as you would care for yourself.

If you correct your mind, the rest of your life will fall into place.
This is true because the mind is the governing aspect of human life.
If the river flows clearly and cleanly through the proper channel,
all will be well along its banks.

The Integral Way depends on decreasing, not increasing:
  To correct your mind, rely on not-doing.
Decrease thinking and clinging to complications;
  keep your mind detached and whole.
Eliminate mental muddiness and obscurity;
  keep your mind crystal clear.
Avoid daydreaming and allow your pure original insight to emerge.
Quiet your emotions and abide in serenity.
Don't go crazy with the worship of idols, images, and ideas;
  this is like putting a new head on top of the head you already have.

Remember: if you can cease all restless activity,
  your integral nature will appear.

Dualistic thinking is a sickness.
Religion is a distortion.
Materialism is cruel.
Blind spirituality is unreal.

Chanting is no more holy than listening to the
  murmur of a stream, counting prayer beads no more
  sacred than simply breathing, religious robes no
  more spiritual than work clothes.

If you wish to attain oneness with the Tao, don't get
  caught up in spiritual superficialities.
Instead, live a quiet and simple life, free of ideas and
  concepts.
Find contentment in the practice of undiscriminating
  virtue, the only true power.
Giving to others selflessly and anonymously, radiating
  light throughout the world and illuminating your
  own darkness, your virtue becomes a sanctuary for
  yourself and all beings.

This is what is meant by embodying the Tao.

[CND, 12/15/93] A women trafficking gang, consisting of 69 members, was
rounded up by the Inner Mongolia police, the Inner Mongolian Daily said.
The gang, operating in several nearby provinces, enticed a total of 200
unemployed women to make the journey to Inner Mongolia with the promise
of good jobs and shelter.  The women, ranging from 15 to 41, then were sold
as wives or servants to local peasants who had difficulties in finding
a spouse.

get the 3d effect, you need to diverge (unfocus) your eyes such that two

the rest of the image should jump out of the screen at you!

Try moving your head back from the screen and moving it about a bit
once you have focused on the image to increase the stereo effect even
more.

     The following a 3-d Maze (3x4) consisting of the following objects:
circle, square, asterisk, hour-glass, triangle, and a square with two lines
in it.  The rules are as follows: You can 'warp' from one part of the maze to
another by matching similar objects.  Each 'warp' counts as one move.  You
can also travel along the lines, if there is a line.  This also counts as one
move.  (I got the idea of this from a GAMES magazine I read a LONG time ago)
Try to go from "START" to "END" in the least amount of moves.  I would give
out a prize to somebody, if I could think of one(that doesn't cost anything,
of course!).  (Take this as a first maze...I didn't plan it out, and it's not
very difficult.)  I would suggest that people that have worked with
stereograms EXTENSIVELY try this, as it is hard to move your eyes around and
still keep focused on the 3-D image.  E-mail me the number of moves it took
you and the path you followed (e.g. 6 Sqauare -warp- Asterisk Circle...etc.),
I'll post the list of people that reply to it within the next week and got
the lowest number of moves.  Good luck!!

Pittsburgh Driver's Test
No. 7:
  The car directly in front of you has a flashing right tail light but
  a steady left tail light.  This means:

(a) one of the tail lights is broken; you should blow your horn to call
    the problem to the driver's attention.
(b) the driver is signaling a right turn.
(c) the driver is signaling a left turn.
(d) the driver is from out of town.


(The correct answer is (d).  Tail lights are used in some foreign
 countries to signal turns.)

The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the
human mind to correlate all its contents.  We live on a placid island of
ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that
we should voyage far.  The sciences, each straining in its own direction,
have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of
dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and
of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the
revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a
new dark age.

In the beginning was The Plan
And then came The Assumptions
And the Assumptions were without form
And The Plan was completely without substance
And the darkness was upon the face of the workers.
And they spoke amongst themselves, saying
  "It is a crock of sh*t, and it stinketh."
And the workers went unto their Supervisors and sayeth,
  "It is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor thereof."
And the Supervisors went unto their Managers and sayeth unto them,
  "It is a container of excrement and it is very stong
Such that none may abide by it."
And the Managers went unto the Directors and sayeth,
  "It is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength."
And the Directors spoke amongst themselves, saying one to another,
  "It contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong."
And the Directors went unto the Vice Presidents and sayeth unto them,
  "It promotes growth and is very powerful."
And the Vice Presidents went unto the President and sayeth unto Him,
  "This new Plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency
   Of this Company, and these Areas in particular."
And the President looked upon The Plan,
And saw that it was good, and The Plan became Policy.
This is how sh*t happens.

The late Dudjom Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma sect of the Tibetan Buddhist
tradition, wrote one book on the evils of tobacco.  He detailed a number of
problems, both physical and spiritual, which would derive from the use of
tobacco.  Interestingly, he claims the origin of the plant to be a demoness
who vowed to take rebirth as a plant to afflict humankind.

Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels
start closing in, the only cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and
then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas... with the
music at top volume and at least a pint of ether.

dude, i have your tickets
for the grateful briquettes
on saturday the 20th.
they are 30 apiece
so get out your wallets
i need the rental lease
or be hit with mallets
for my friend has no peace
and i have no ballots.
without which you get no tickets
for my friend has no spigots
disgorging money in hiccups
in the land of honey and pickups.

Some people imagine that only the person who physically carries out the
killing is creating a negative karmic effect, and that the person who just
gave the orders is not--or, if he is, then only a little.  But you
should know that the same karmic result comes to everyone involved,
including even anyone who just felt pleased about it--and therefore how
much more so the person who actually ordered that the killing be carried
out.  Each person gets the whole karmic result of killing one animal.  It
is not as if one act of killing could be divided up among many people.

  From the Nying-ma _kunzang lama'i shelung_ (The Words of My Perfect Teacher)
  written by Patrul Rinpoche (1808-1887), (Padmakara translation group,
  trans., New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1994, 104.)

did you hear about the professor that got some human lips grafted onto his
anus?  then when his students were kissing butt, they could get some response.
and he can also now wear a hat on his ass and sit on his head, and no one
knows the difference...
~
Alpha:
Software undergoes alpha testing as a first step in getting user
feedback.  Alpha is Latin for "doesn't work."
~
Beta:
Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it's released.  Beta is
Latin for "still doesn't work."
~
Computer:
Instrument of torture.  The first computer was invented by Roger
"Duffy" Billingsly, a British scientist.  In a plot to overthrow Adolf
Hitler, Duffy disguised himself as a German ally and offered his
invention as a gift to the surly dictator.  The plot worked.  On April
8, 1945, Adolf became so enraged at the "Incompatible File Format"
error message that he shot himself.  The war ended soon after Hitler's
death, and Duffy began working for IBM.
~
CPU:
Central propulsion unit.  The CPU is the computer's engine.  It
consists of a hard drive, an interface card and a tiny spinning wheel
that's powered by a running rodent--a gerbil if the machine is a 286,
a ferret if it's a 386 and a ferret on speed if it's a 486.
~
Default Directory:
Black hole.  Default directory is where all files that you need
disappear to.
~
Error message:
Terse, baffling remark used by programmers to place blame on users for
the program's shortcomings.
~
File:
A document that has been saved with an unidentifiable name.  It helps
to think of a file as something stored in a file cabinet--except when
you try to remove the file, the cabinet gives you an electric shock
and tells you the file format is unknown.
~
Hardware:
Collective term for any computer-related object that can be kicked or
battered.
~
Help:
The feature that assists in generating more questions.  When the help
feature is used correctly, users are able to navigate through a series
of Help screens and end up where they started from without learning
anything.
~
Input/Output:
Information is input from the keyboard as intelligible data and output
to the printer as unrecognizable junk.
~
Interim Release:
A programmer's feeble attempt at repentance.
~
Memory:
Of computer components, the most generous in terms of variety, and the
skimpiest in terms of quantity.
~
Printer:
A joke in poor taste.  A printer consists of three main parts: the
case, the jammed paper tray and the blinking red light.
~
Programmers:
Computer avengers.  Once members of that group of high school nerds
who wore tape on their glasses, played Dungeons and Dragons, and
memorized Star Trek episodes; now millionaires who create
"user-friendly" software to get revenge on whoever gave them noogies.
~
Reference Manual:
Object that raises the monitor to eye level.  Also used to compensate
for that short table leg.
~
Scheduled Release Date:
A carefully calculated date determined by estimating the actual
shipping date and subtracting six months from it.
~
User-Friendly:
Of or pertaining to any feature, device or concept that makes perfect
sense to a programmer.
~
Users:
Collective term for those who stare vacantly at a monitor.  Users are
divided into three types: novice, intermediate and expert.
  - Novice Users--People who are afraid that simply pressing a key
    might break their computer.
  - Intermediate Users--People who don't know how to fix their computer
    after they've just pressed a key that broke it.
  - Expert Users--People who break other people's computers.

WHY GOD NEVER RECEIVED TENURE AT ANY UNIVERSITY

1.  He had only one major publication.
2.  It had no references.
3.  It wasn't published in a refereed journal.
4.  Some even doubt he wrote it himself.
5.  It may be true that he created the world,
    but what has he done since then?
6.  His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.
7.  The scientific community has had a hard time
    replicating his results.
8.  He never applied to the Ethics Board
    for permission to use human subjects.
9.  When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it up
    by drowning the subjects.
10. When subjects didn't behave as predicted,
    he deleted them from the sample.
11. He rarely came to class, just told students
    to read the Book.
12. Some say he had his son teach the class.
13. He expelled his first two students for learning.
14. Although there were only ten requirements,
    most students failed his tests.
15. His office hours were infrequent and usually
    held on a mountaintop.

  there are some who believe that intelligence can only be won at the cost of
other's intelligence; that is, there is no way to be intelligent without being
more intelligent than someone else.  i hypothesize that talking to this kind

in is proving how much smarter they are than you are.

to talk to; they want you to know what they know and vice-versa, not to prove
that they are the most intelligent person in the room.

A freshman at Eagle Rock Junior High won first prize at the Greater Idaho
Falls Science Fair, April 26.  He was attempting to show how conditioned
we have become to the alarmists practicing junk science and spreading fear
of everything in our environment.  In his project he urged people to sign
a petition demanding strict control or total elimination of the chemical
"dihydrogen monoxide."  And for plenty of good reasons, since

      1.  it can cause excessive sweating and vomiting;
      2.  it is a major component in acid rain;
      3.  it can cause severe burns in its gaseous state;
      4.  accidental inhalation can kill you;
      5.  it contributes to erosion;
      6.  it decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes;
      7.  it has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients.

He asked 50 people if they supported a ban of the chemical.  Forty-three said
yes, six were undecided, and only one knew that the chemical was water.  The
title of his prize winning project was, "How Gullible Are We?".
The conclusion is obvious.

Testimonial from Col. George Harvey, Mark Twain's publisher:
    I think that perhaps the funniest thing about Mark Twain now is not
his writing, but his bed.  He lies in bed a good deal; he says he has
formed the habit.  His bed is the largest one I ever saw, and on it is
the weirdest collection of objects you ever saw, enough to furnish a
Harlem flat--books, writing materials, clothes, any and everything that
could foregather in his vicinity.
    He looks quite happy rising out of the mass, and over all prowls a
huge black cat of a very unhappy disposition.  She snaps and snarls and
claws and bites, and Mark Twain takes his turn with the rest; when she
gets tired of tearing up manuscript she scratches him and he bears it
with a patience wonderful to behold.

Testimonial from Katy Leary, Mark Twain's servant:
    Mr. Clemens borrowed a kitten one time, called Bambino, from Clara, who
had him in the sanitarium, and had trained him to wash his own face in the
bowl every morning--which shows that he was a very smart little cat.  He
used to have this kitten up in his room at the Fifth Avenue house and he
taught it to put out a light, too. He had a tiny little lamp to light his
cigars with at the head of the bed, and after he got all fixed and didn't
want the light any more, he taught that cat to put his paw on the light
and put it out.  Bambino would jump on the bed, look at Mr. Clemens to see
if he was through with the light, and when Mr. Clemens would bow twice to
him, he'd jump over on to that table quick, and put his little paw right
on the lamp!  Mr. Clemens was always showing him off; he did that for a lot
of people that come there to call.
    One night he got kind of gay, when he heard some cats calling from the
back fence, so he found a window open and he stole out.  We looked high
and low but couldn't find him.  Mr. Clemens felt so bad that he advertised
in all the papers for him.  He offered a reward for anybody that would
bring the cat back.  My goodness! the people that came bringing cats to
that house!  A perfect stream!  They all wanted to see Mr. Clemens, of
course.
    Two or three nights after, Katherine heard a cat meowing across the
street in General Sickles' back yard, and there was Bambino--large as
life!  So she brought him right home.  Mr. Clemens was delighted and then
he advertised that his cat was found!  But the people kept coming just
the same with all kinds of cats for him--anything to get a glimpse of
Mr. Clemens!

Speaking the Same Language: As director of communications I was asked to
prepare a memo reviewing our company's training programs and materials.  In
the body of the memo one of the sentences mentioned the "pedagogical approach"
used by one of the training manuals.  The day after I routed the memo to the
executive committee, I was called into the HR director's office and told that
the executive vice president wanted me out of the building by lunch.  When I
asked why, I was told that she wouldn't stand for "perverts" (pedophilia)?
working in her company.  Finally he showed me her copy of the memo, with her
demand that I be fired--and the word "pedagogical" circled in red.  The HR
manager was fairly reasonable, and once he looked the word up in his
dictionary, and made a copy of the definition to send back to her, he told me
not to worry.  He would take care of it.  Two days later a memo to the entire
staff came out--directing us that no words which could not be found in the
local Sunday newspaper could be used in company memos.  A month later, I
resigned.  In accordance with company policy, I created my resignation memo
by pasting words together from the Sunday paper.

[Modern economists are] "used to measuring the 'standard of living' by
the amount of annual consumption, assuming all the time that a man who
consumes more is 'better off' than a man who consumes less.  A Buddhist
economist would consider this approach excessively irrational: since
consumption is merely a means to human well-being, the aim should be to
obtain the maximum of well-being with the minimum of consumption...
The less toil there is, the more time and strength is left for artistic
creativity.  Modern economics, on the other hand, considers consumption
to be the sole end and purpose of all economic activity."

on exception handling...
    the point is to create dependable systems.  some languages are better than
others for this.  some languages provide no support for verification, although
the semantics of most programming constructs are well established.  exceptions
predate much of the work done in formal verification of the last 30 years.
many people have tried (with varying degrees of success) to fit exceptions into
the grand scheme and make them verifiable.  flaviu cristian has shown how
exception handlers can be fitted with preconditions for their activation and
postconditions for their completion.
    however, an attempt to postfit a system with hooks for verifiability will
fail if the system is very large.  and programming in this manner is simply a
living hell.  the programmer is not generally equipped to set up all of his
handlers for this type of reasoning, even if he has a clear idea for when the
handlers are to be invoked.
    what is needed is a general language structure that is capable of embodying
the reasons and the services of the exception-like items in the system.

the drug war is a war on liberty that cannot possibly be won without the

urine testing is the best emblem of this horrible war; it makes the police
look like a bunch of perverted piss sniffers.  it is not cost effective
for testing large numbers of people and it is insanely easy to fake if one
wants to anyway.  we need to stop the drug war and start the war on ignorance.
this ignorance is an ignorance of the REAL scientifically determined results

DOES have therapeutic results and that it is almost completely HARMLESS.
smoke inhalation is not harmless, but there are other ways to get stoned than
by inhaling burning vapors.  the root ignorance that MUST be warred upon is

drug prices are caused to soar by the organized crime elements
that are behind the drug war (and behind the republican party).
organized crime at the same time causes the war to look just as
ridiculous as the carrie nation hatchet smashing of beer kegs so
that people will buy more drugs and think that governmental
authority is a crock.  who benefitted from the intense CAMP
activity in california?  the mafia, because prices on marijuana
soared.  who got screwed by CAMP?  the people, who made their
honest living off of growing marijuana, which at the time was
our nation's largest commodity.  it's time to toss the republican
crooks out of office on their asses.  american patriots smoke pot:
george washington, thomas jefferson, benjamin franklin, and thou,
if you like.  unamerican creeps are against marijuana and against

ode to a petty tyrant...
  what you don't seem to realize is that productivity is mood dependent.
you seem to think that i need to be degraded repeatedly as some form of
character builder, but what if someone came to this school as your student
who had already been degraded enough in his life?  what if every time you
were cutting on them in some sly tricky sarcastic form you were in fact
rubbing a sore spot and only inflaming their opinions as to your anus-nature?
  did you realize that one of your students comes back to the office
and just swears and swears at the computer he's working at?  this wasn't
because the machine was bad, or his program was bad, or he was bad,
but because he was mad at _you_.
  the solution, i think, is to respect people a whole lot more.  we're
not here for professors to deride us.  this isn't some f*cking fraternity
with you chumps as the chief hazing marshalls.  we're here to learn and if
our learning is colored with hues of condemnation and abuse, it diminishes
you, it diminishes us, and it diminishes the whole search for truth and
knowledge.

i don't believe the druidic and grecian universities had this
same kind of "cut him up, slice and dice!" attitude that prevails
at our fine american universities in this day and age.  that
attitude is surely a holdover from roman times, when the
patriarchal society demanded discipline and obedience from all
of its members, especially those with license to think.  this
approach is impractical these days (because it doesn't work
very well), except at the higher levels in education, where
it is still fervently practiced.  root it out, toss it away;
we don't need authoritarian learning, we need to follow the truth
back to all its origins and forward to the myriad potential fruits.

on artistic and technical integrity...
in the beginning, i had a totally egotistical attitude that the rest of the
world was screwed and i was right.  this is actually somewhat correct, because
one must have his own voice and thoughts, except for the fact that i was not
_that_ correct and the world was not _that_ wrong.  but at least what i chose
to say and what i chose to be were right for me.  over the past few years i
have sought to learn the phd game, but i have been doing it by suppressing
my own voice and allowing others to tell me what i should say.  this is
fundamentally f*cked, because now i have become dependent on them as my voice
instead of relying on the tao to guide the research and for my own voice to
speak what needs to be said.  is it any wonder that i have devolved to this
state of being unable to say anything on my own?  after years of thinking for
myself, i have allowed myself to become placed in a situation where i was
dependent on someone else as my source of "the scoop".  numerous problems
result when others' biases are not what i want to express, yet they have
potency to affect my presentation.  the fact that when the bogus guru doesn't
understand something, he usually tells you that you are the one who does not
understand, is no help.  he has no subtlety and yet seeks the original
thoughts, leading him to warp other people's original thoughts into his own
mental framework, often losing the original spark and leading the ideas astray
into his own personal interests.  i need to cut loose and start thinking on my
own again.  if the ideas in my research here have any merit at all, they have
to be proven using my own metrics, not others' metrics.  and this no longer
seems possible in this stringently bulletheaded "hard science" department
which instead only enforces conventional viewpoints and does not reach out
into the unknown where the really interesting concepts live....

niceness here is the ineffable.
the only difference between you and the wolf is that you want to be nice,
and fail.  the wolf only wants to appear nice while remaining vile inside,
and he succeeds.  your demeanor to others is sometimes nice and sometimes
not nice because of your failures in actually being the way you want to
be.  and the reason that you fail to be the way you want to be is that you
lack the spiritual strength to keep it up.  you can't synchronize your
noble desires with your weak mind/body, and it is mainly because you reject
spirituality itself that you fail in achieving spiritual strength.
one cannot succeed in something one does not believe in except through
dumb beginner's luck.  and yet to fully believe in something is to be
trapped in it, without the capacity to disbelieve and free oneself.
you need a fluid belief that accepts what is true within the constraints
of its validity.  can this flow be strong enough to become who and what
you want to be?

    A herd of buffalo can move only as fast as the slowest buffalo.
when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back
that are killed first.  This natural selection is good for the herd as a
whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
improving by the regular culling of the weakest members.
    In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as
the slowest brain cells.  Intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain
cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells
first.  In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker
brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.

The local betaware broker was sitting in the bar, keeping an eye
for potential customers.  It was easy to spot him, once you knew
the signs.  A slightly paranoid look, but still eager to meet
new people.  Not unlike a drug dealer or prostitute.  This guy,
however, was carrying a laptop.
   I sat in the chair beside him.  "Any new stuff for
Linux configuration?", I said, looking at the opposite wall
of bottles.
   The broker looked at me, startled, then quickly away.  Then
back at me.  "What are you, a cop?" The traditional greeting of
the underworld.  It made me feel right at home.
   "Nope, I just want to install Deb..."
   "Shutup.  I don't want to go to jail."

  Here is a time-table of my daily acts.  I rise at 7.18; am inspired from
10.23 to 11.47.  I lunch at 12.11 and leave the table at 12.14.  A healthy
ride on horse-back round my domain follows from 1.19 pm to 2.53 pm.  Another
bout of inspiration from 3.12 to 4.7 pm.  From 5 to 6.47 pm various
occupations (fencing, reflection, immobility, visits, contemplation,
dexterity, natation, etc.)

  Dinner is served at 7.16 and finished at 7.20 pm.  From 8.9 to 9.59 pm
symphonic readings (out loud).  I go to bed regularly at 10.37 pm.  Once a
week (on Tuesdays) I awake with a start at 3.14 am.

  My only nourishment consists of food that is white: eggs, sugar, shredded
bones, the fat of dead animals, veal, salt, coco-nuts, chicken cooked in
white water, moldy fruit, rice, turnips, sausages in camphor, pastry, cheese
(white varieties), cotton salad, and certain kinds of fish (without their
skin).  I boil my wine and drink it cold mixed with the juice of the
Fuschia.  I have a good appetite but never talk when eating for fear of
strangling myself.

  I breathe carefully (a little at a time) and dance very rarely.  When
walking I hold my ribs and look steadily behind me.

  My expression is very serious; when I laugh it is unintentional, and I
always apologize very politely.

  I sleep with only one eye closed, very profoundly.  My bed is round with a
hole in it for my head to go through.  Every hour a servant takes my
temperature and gives me another.

    It is fair to say that, in general, no problems have been exhausted;
instead, men have been exhausted by the problems.  Fresh talent approaching
the analysis of a problem without prejudice will always see new
possibilities -- some aspect not considered by those who believe that a
subject is fully understood.  Our knowledge is so fragmentary that
unexpected findings appear in even the most fully explored topics...
    In summary, there are no small problems.  Problems that appear small
are large problems that are not understood.  Instead of tiny details
unworthy of the intellectual, we have men whose tiny intellects cannot rise
to penetrate the infinitesimal.  Nature is a harmonious mechanism where all
parts, including those appearing to play a secondary role, cooperate in a
functional whole.  In contemplating this mechanism, shallow men arbitrarily
divide its parts into essential and secondary, whereas the insightful
thinker is content with classifying them as understood and poorly
understood, ignoring for the moment their size and immediately useful
properties.  No one can predict their importance in the future."

  If we will only allow that, as we progress, we remain unsure, we will
leave opportunities for alternatives.  We will not become enthusiastic for
the fact, the knowledge, the absolute truth of the day, but remain always
uncertain.  The English have developed their government in this direction, it
is called 'muddling through,' and although a rather silly, stupid sounding
thing, it is the most scientific way of progressing.  To decide upon the
answer is not scientific.  In order to make progress, one must leave the door
to the unknown ajar.
  We are only at the beginning of the development of the human race; of
the development of the human mind, of intelligent life; we have years and
years in the future.  It is our responsibility not to give an answer today as
to what it is all about, to drive everybody down in that direction and say:
'This is the solution to it all.'  Because we will be chained to the limit
of our present imagination, we will only be able to do those things that we
think are the things to do.  Whereas, if we leave some room for discussion,
and proceed in a way analogous to the sciences, then this difficulty will
not arise.  I believe, therefore, that although it is not the case today,
there may some day come a time, or I should hope, that the power of
government should be limited.  That governments ought not to be empowered to
decide the validity of scientific theories.  That is a ridiculous thing for
them to try to do.  That they are not to decide the various descriptions of
history or of economic theory or of philosophy.
  Only in this way can the real possibilities of the future human race be
ultimately developed.

The spirit of the age cannot be compassed by the processes of human
reason.  It is an inclination, an emotional tendency that works upon weaker
minds, through the unconscious, with an overwhelming force of suggestion
that carries them along with it.  To think otherwise than our contemporaries
think is somehow illegitimate and disturbing; it is even indecent, morbid
or blasphemous, and therefore socially dangerous for the individual.  He is
stupidly swimming against the social current.  Just as formerly the
assumption was unquestionable that everything that exists takes its rise
from the creative will of a God who is spirit, so the nineteenth century
discovered the equally unquestionable truth that everything arises from
material causes.  Today the psyche does not build itself a body, but on the
contrary, matter, by chemical action, produces the psyche.  This reversal of
outlook would be ludicrous if it were not one of the outstanding features of
the spirit of the age.  It is the popular way of thinking, and therefore it
is decent, reasonable, scientific and normal.  Mind must be thought to be an
epiphenomenon of matter.  The same conclusion is reached even if we say not
"mind" but "psyche," and in place of matter speak of brain, hormones,
instincts or drives.  To grant the substantiality of the soul or psyche is
repugnant to the spirit of the age, for to do so would be heresy.

There are many ways to explain an event, and some are better than
others.  Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring
diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it
is explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts

crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler
acts of living things.  As Richard Dawkins observed, 'If you throw
a dead bird into the air it will describe a graceful parabola,
exactly as physics books say it should, then come to rest on the
ground and stay there.  It behaves as a solid body of a particular
mass and wind resistance ought to behave.  But if you throw a live
bird in the air it will not describe a parabola and come to rest on
the ground.  It will fly away, and may not touch land this side of
the county boundary.'  We understand birds in terms of their innards.
To know why they move and grow, we cut them open and put bits under
a microscope.  We need yet another kind of explanation for artifacts
like a chair and a crowbar: a statement of the function the object is
intended to perform.  It would be silly to understand why chairs have
a stable horizontal surface by cutting them open and putting bits of
them under a microscope.  The explanation is that someone designed
the chair to hold up a human behind.

    What wonder, then, that the world goes from bad to worse, and that
its evils increase more and more, as boredom increases, and boredom is the
root of all evil.  The history of this can be traced from the very beginning
of the world.  The gods were bored, and so they created man.  Adam was bored
because he was alone, and so Eve was created.  Thus boredom entered the
world, and increased in proportion to the increase of population.  Adam was
bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored together, then Adam and Eve and
Cain and Abel were bored en famille; then the population of the world
increased, and the peoples were bored en masse.  To divert themselves they
conceived the idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens.
This idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a
terrible proof of how boredom gained the upper hand.

    The group cannot function if it has to maintain a large amount of
individual preconceptions and personal experiences.  The design group must,
as a whole, have the ability and the opportunity to leave things behind,
that is, select what to remember.
    If designers are to come up with novel ideas, they may have to forget
what was 'named and framed' as a problem or solution earlier in the process.
A group of designers needs to work its way through ideas, visions, and
operative images without being held up by heavy demands for documentation of
the process.  In a creative design process one thing leads to another,
analogies and metaphors influence the design thinking in new ways, and a
certain amount of chaos is always present...
    The characteristics of oral cultures can be applied to group design...
Group members need to repeat themselves, to be redundant and nonlinear in
their arguments, to forget, to make references and analogies in a situated
and intuitive ways.

    Where science has progressed by searching for commonalities and
patterns, the arts have celebrated diversity and have resisted attempts to
encapsulate their activities in rules and formulae.  They are the ultimate
manifestations of the unpredictabilities and asymmetries of Nature.  After
all, what more chaotically unpredictable outcomes are there than some of
those that issue from the human mind?  So intractable has been the problem
of finding pattern in creative activity, that few would even seek it.  If
one looks not at science and art, but at scientists and artists, one finds a
reflection of this divide.  Two populations that overlap only a little,
convergent thinkers and divergent thinkers, specialists and generalists --
these labels reflect the differences of which we speak...
    While science has enlarged its past horizons beyond order and symmetry
to embrace diversity and unpredictability, the humanities have yet to
appreciate the full force of commonality and pattern as a unifying factor in
the interpretation of human creativity.  Just as science has begun to
appreciate the ways in which its view of Nature must reconcile the ways in
which Nature is both simple and complex, so the arts and humanities must
appreciate the lessons to be drawn from the regularities of Nature.  It is
not enough to collect examples of diversity: the coexistence of diversity
with universal behavior is what requires exploration and reconciliation.

    I first became interested in Darwin in college when I read about
Darwin's experience with John Gould.  When Darwin returned to England after
he visited the Galapagos, he distributed his finch specimens to professional
zoologists to be properly identified.  One of the most distinguished experts
was John Gould.  What was the most revealing was not what happened to Darwin,
but what had not happened to Gould.
    Darwin's notes show Gould taking him through all the birds he had
named.  Gould kept flip-flopping back and forth about the number of
different species of finches: The information was there, but he didn't quite
know what to make of it.  He assumed that since God made one set of birds
when he created the world, the specimens from different locations would be
identical.  It didn't occur to him to look for differences by location.  Gould
thought that the birds were so different that they might be distinct species.
    What was remarkable to me about the encounter is the completely
different impact it had on the two men.  Gould thought the way he had been
taught to think, like an expert taxonomist, and didn't see, in the finches,
the textbook example of evolution unfolding right before him.  Darwin didn't
even know they were finches.  So the guy who had the intelligence, knowledge,
and the expertise didn't see the differences, and the guy with far less
knowledge and expertise came up with an idea that shaped the way we think
about the world.
    Darwin came up with the idea because he was a productive thinker.  He
generated a multiplicity of perspectives and theories.  Gould would compare
new ideas and theories with his existing patterns of experience.  He thought
reproductively.  If the ideas didn't fit with what he had been taught, he
rejected them as worthless.  On the other hand, Darwin was willing to
disregard what past thinkers thought and was willing to entertain different
perspectives and different theories to see where they would lead.
    Most of us are educated to think like John Gould.  We were all born
to be spontaneous, creative thinkers.  Yet a great deal of our education may
be regarded as the inculcation of mind-sets.  We were taught how to handle
problems and new phenomena with fixed mental attitudes (based on what past
thinkers thought) that predetermine our responses to problems or situations.
In short, we were taught 'what' to think instead of 'how' to think.  We
entered school as a question mark and graduated a period.

    The wisdom of the late industrial era was always to start with what
the customer needed and backtrack to which products and services those needs
called for.  That fit when the customer already understood the need and the
product, and innovation meant a different shaped bottle for liquid detergent.
In BLUR, technical change is happening so fast, your product must educate the
customer (beepers for kids on dates?) and the customer must educate you.  You
can't afford the time delay to put something new in front of the customer.
    Instead, start with what technology will make possible, co-develop it as
fast as you can with the customer, and be flexible and adaptive enough to
adjust it according to customer needs as you go.  As in software, the first
release is your take on things.  The customer enters the feedback loop and
starts to influence things with release 2.0 and beyond.

    The traditional hidden curriculum of school demands that people of a
certain age assemble in groups of about thirty under the authority of a
professional teacher for from five hundred to a thousand times a year.  It
does not matter if the teacher is authoritarian so long as it is the
teacher's authority that counts; it does not matter if all meetings occur
in the same place so long as they are somehow understood as attendance.  The
hidden curriculum of school requires--whether by law or by fact--that a
citizen accumulate a minimum quantum of school years in order to obtain his
civil rights...
    The translation of the need for learning into the demand for schooling
and the conversion of the quality of growing up into the price tag of a
professional treatment changes the meaning of 'knowledge' from a term that
designates intimacy, intercourse, and life experience into one that
designates professionally packaged products, marketable entitlements, and
abstract values.

    History tells us that the most successful cures for poverty come from
within.  Foreign aid can help, but like windfall wealth, can also hurt.  It
can discourage effort and plant a crippling sense of incapacity.  As the
African saying has it, 'The hand that receives is always under the one that
gives.'  No, what counts is work, thrift, honesty, patience, and tenacity...
    To be sure, we are living in a dessert age.  We want things to be
sweet; too many of us work to live and live to be happy.  Nothing wrong with
that; it just does not promote high productivity.  You want high productivity?
Then you should live to work and get happiness as a by-product.
    Not easy.  They who live to work are a small and fortunate elite.  But
it is an elite open to newcomers, self-selected, the kind of people who
accentuate the positive.  In this world, the optimists have it, not because
they are always right, but because they are positive.  Even when wrong, they
are positive, and that is the way of achievement, correction, improvement,
and success.  Educated, eyes-open optimism pays; pessimism can only offer
the empty consolation of being right.
    The one lesson that emerges is the need to keep trying.  No miracles.
No perfection.  No millennium.  No apocalypse.  We must cultivate a
skeptical faith, avoid dogma, listen and watch well, try to clarify and
define ends, the better to choose means.

    During my travels around the country, visiting inner-city neighborhoods
and talking to young people I've met there, I have been struck again and
again by the stark differences between their childhoods and my own.  When I
was growing up in the Bronx, I wasn't rich -- at least not in a material
sense, but I had the matchless blessing of being reared by two devoted
parents--backed up by a platoon of doting aunts and uncles--who gave me
the love, discipline and motivation I needed to succeed.
    Too many of today's kids are not getting the same kind of nurturing
environment that I -- and most Americans -- once took for granted.  As many
as 15 million youngsters are 'at risk' in today's America.  They are in
danger of being lost for good unless the more fortunate among us step
forward and lend a hand...  It is this glorious cycle of giving, receiving
and giving back that we want to pass along to the next generation of
Americans.  We want them to believe in America, and we want them to know
that America believes in them.

    In the past fifteen years one big American company after another has
done this [i.e., downsized itself] -- among them IBM, Sears, and GM.  Each
first announced that laying off 10,000 or 20,000 or even 50,000 people would
lead to an immediate turnaround.  A year later there had, of course, been no
turnaround, and the company laid off another 10,000 or 20,000 or 50,000 --
again without results.  In many if not most cases, downsizing has turned out
to be something that surgeons have warned against: 'amputation before
diagnosis.'  The result is always a casualty.
    But there have been a few organizations -- some large companies (GE,
for instance) and a few hospitals (Beth Israel in Boston, for instance) --
that quietly, and without fanfare, did turn themselves around, by rethinking
themselves.  They did not start out by downsizing.  If fact, they knew that
to start by reducing expenditures is not the way to get control of costs.
The starting point is to identify the activities that are productive, that
should be strengthened, promoted, and expanded.  Every agency, every policy,
every program, every activity should be confronted with these questions:
'What is your mission?'  'Is it still the right mission?'  'Is it still
worth doing?'  'If we were not already doing this, would we go into it now?'
This questioning has been done often enough in all kinds of organizations --
businesses, hospitals, churches, an even local governments -- that we know
it works.
    The overall answer is almost never 'This is fine as it stands;  let's
keep on.'  But in some -- indeed, a good many -- areas, the answer to the
last question is 'Yes, we should go into this again, but with some changes.
We have learned a few things.'

    Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
General recognition of this fact is shown in the proverbial phrase 'It is
the busiest man who has time to spare.'  Thus, an elderly lady of leisure
can spend the entire day in writing and dispatching a postcard to her niece
at Bognor Reis.  An hour will be spent in finding the postcard, half an
hour in a search for spectacles, half an hour in a search for the address,
an hour and a quarter in composition, and twenty minutes in deciding
whether or not to take an umbrella when going to the mailbox in the next
street.  The total effort that would occupy a busy man [or woman] for three
minutes all told may in this fashion leave another person [man or woman]
prostate after a day of doubt, anxiety, and toil.
    Granted that work (and especially paperwork) is thus elastic in its
demands on time, it is manifest that there need be little or no
relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which
it may be assigned.  A lack of real activity does not, of necessity, result
in leisure.  A lack of occupation is not necessarily revealed by a manifest
idleness.  The thing to be done swells in importance and complexity in a
direct ration with the time to be spent.  This fact is widely recognized,
but less attention has been paid to its wider implications, more especially
in the field of publication administration.  Politicians and taxpayers have
assume (with occasional phases of doubt) that a rising total in the number
of civil servants must reflect a growing volume of work to be done.
Cynics, in questioning this belief, have imagined that the multiplication
of officials must have left some of them idle or all of them able to work
for shorter hours.  But this is a matter in which faith and doubt seem
equally misplaced.  The fact is that the number of officials and the
quantity of the work are not related to each other at all.  The rise in the
toil of those employed is governed by Parkinson's Law and would be much the
same whether the volume of the work were to increase, diminish, or even
disappear.  The importance of Parkinson's Law lies in the fact that it is a
law of growth based upon an analysis of the factors by which that growth is
controlled.
    The validity of this recently discovered law must rest mainly on
statistical proofs, which will follow.  Of more interest to the general
reader is the explanation of the factors underlying the general tendency to
which this law gives definition.  Omitting technicalities (which are
numerous) we may distinguish at the outset two motive forces.  They can be
represented for the present purpose by two almost axiomatic statements,
thus:  (1) 'An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals' and (2)
'Officials make work for each other.'

    Though it may be discomforting to admit, throughout history children
have always played violent games.  Early in this century, young boys played
'war' with lines of tin soldiers, knocking them down one by one, or in one
fell swoop, in a simulated battle.  The next generation played cowboys and
Indians or cops and robbers, where the youngsters themselves fell down and
played dead.  When parents stopped buying soldier figures and fake guns,
children created their own weapons and continued to play out good guy/bad
guy plots.  Children are attracted to violence and critical studies of
older media forms, including the fairy tale, suggest it is not always in
children's best interests to remove from their cultural experience all
material that parents deem is too provocative or violent.
    This is not a simple issue.
    Clearly much of the concern about violence in video games and other
media is misplaced--the main sources of violent behavior lies elsewhere.
These include parental violence toward children and violence between
nations which portray the use of force in the real world by important
institutions--parents and government--as an acceptable way to solve
problems or vent anger.
    Nevertheless, the impact of video games, television, film or other
media violence (such as the gory details of murders in the print media)
probably has a negative impact on violent behavior in society, as does the
proliferation of weapons.
    The impact of media violence on an individual child's behavior is
probably very specific to the child and his or her social context.  There
is no evidence, for example, that the use of "Beat-'em-up" video games
leads to violent behavior of well-adjusted youth coming from loving
families.  The impact is also probably specific to age.  Just as it makes
sense to restrict a 10-year-old's access to movies with extreme violent
content, so it makes sense to restrict age-inappropriate video games.  Age
ratings on video game packages do appear to be helpful and appropriate.
    Most violent games today are cartoon-like.  This will change as games
become more realistic and, 3D, and eventually realistic of virtual reality,
ensuring that this issue will not disappear.
    It is inappropriate for children of any age to spend significant
parts of life using violent video games, or any video games for that
matter.  Conversely, for most children it makes little sense to deny access
to age-appropriate games simply for fear that these will lead to antisocial
behavior.  Successful parenting is a question of balance.

    Literacy-based education, as all other literacy experiences, assumes
that people are the same.  It presumes that each human being can and must
be literate.  Just as the goal of industry was to turn out standardized
products, education assumes the same task through the mold of literacy.
Diplomas and certificates testify how like the mold the product is.  To
those who have problems with writing or reading, the labels legasthenic and
dyslexic are applied.  Dyscalculus is the name given to the inability to
cope with numbers.  The question of why we should expect uniform cognitive
structures covering the literate use of language or numbers, but not the
use of sounds, colors, shapes, and volume, is never raised.  Tremendous
effort is made to help individuals who simply cannot execute the
sequentiality of writing or the meaning of successive numbers.  Nothing
similar is done to address cognitive characteristics of persons inclined to
means different from literacy...
    Education needs to reconsider its expectation of a universal common
denominator, based on the industrial model of standardization.  Rather than
taming and sanitizing the minds of students, education has not only to
acknowledge differences in aptitudes and interests but also to stimulate
them.  Every known form of energy is the expression of difference and not
the result of leveling.

    Anthropologists have identified a number of characteristics that seem
common to most non-technological societies past and present.  These
societies tend to value practical rather than abstract knowledge, their
'primitive' rituals are part of the regular day-to-day realities of life,
the groups tend not to support specialists other than the shaman, every
member of the group can to some extent do every task, and all share the
responsibility for all others.  Principally, the 'primitive' takes a holist
view of life that examines all social decisions for their effect on the
community and the environment.
    These social values may fit well in the webbed communities of the
mid-twenty-first century because they are more appropriate to small,
relatively simple social structures that up to now had seemed to be
disappearing...  For such communities, the most valuable skills would be
generalist rather than specialist.  They would prize the ability to
connect, to think imaginatively, to understand how data are related, to see
patterns in machine-generated innovation, and to assess its social effect
before releasing it on society...
    Today, billions of human talents could be on the verge of
self-expression if we are willing to take new views and see where they
might lead us.

    A most nerve-wracking confirmation of this came some time ago during
an interview with the producer and the writer of the TV mini-series 'Peter
the Great.'  Defending the historical inaccuracies in the drama -- which
included a fabricated meeting between Peter and Sir Isaac Newton -- the
producer said that no one would watch a dry, historically faithful
biography.  The writer added that it is better for audiences to learn
something that is untrue, if it is entertaining, than not to learn anything
at all.  And just to put some icing on the cake, the actor who played Peter,
Maximilian Schell, remarked that he does not believe in historical truth and
therefore sees no reason to pursue it.
    I do not mean to say that the trivialization of American public
discourse is all accomplished on television.  Rather, television is the
paradigm for all our attempts at public communication.  It conditions our
minds to apprehend the world through fragmented pictures and forces other
media to orient themselves in that direction...
    As a medium for conducting public business, language has receded in
importance;  it has been moved to the periphery of culture and has been
replaced at the center by the entertaining visual image...  When a culture
becomes overloaded with pictures;  when logic and rhetoric lose their
binding authority;  when historical truth becomes irrelevant;  when the
spoken or written word is distrusted or makes demands on our attention that
we are incapable of giving;  when our politics, history, education,
religion, public information, and commerce are expressed largely in visual
imagery rather than words, then a culture is in serious jeopardy.

    It is a perplexing and unpleasant truth that when men already have
'something worth fighting for,' they do not feel like fighting.  People who
live full, worthwhile lives are not usually ready to die for their own
interests nor for their country nor for a holy cause.  Craving, not having,
is the mother of a reckless giving of oneself.
    'Things which are not' are indeed mightier than 'things that are.' In
all ages men have fought most desperately for beautiful cities yet to be
built and gardens yet to be planted...
    It is strange, indeed, that those who hug the present and hang on to
it with all their might should be the least capable of defending it.  And
that, on the other hand, those who spurn the present and dust their hands of
it should have all its gifts and treasures showered on them unasked.
    Dreams, vision and wild hopes are mighty weapons and realistic tools.
The practical-mindedness of a true leader consists in recognizing the
practical value of these tools.  Yet this recognition usually stems from a
contempt of the present which can be traced to a natural ineptitude in
practical affairs.  The successful businessman is often a failure as a
communal leader because his mind is attuned to the 'things that are' and his
heart set on that which can be accomplished in 'our time.'  Failure in the
management of practical affairs seems to be a qualification for success in
the management of public affairs.  And it is perhaps fortunate that some
proud natures when suffering defeat in the practical world do not feel
crushed but are suddenly fired with the apparently absurd conviction that
they are eminently competent to direct the fortunes of the community and the
nation.

    Love is one aspect of what I have called the productive orientation:
the active and creative relatedness of man to his fellow man, to himself and
to nature.  In the realm of thought, this productive orientation is
expressed in the proper grasp of the world by reason.  In the realm of
action, the productive orientation is expressed in productive work, the
prototype of which is art and craftsmanship.  In the realm of feeling, the
productive orientation is expressed in love, which is the experience of
union with another person, with all men, and with nature, under the
condition of retaining one's sense of integrity and independence.  In the
experience of love the paradox happens that two people become one, and
remain two at the same time.  Love in this sense is never restricted to one
person.  If I can love only one person, and nobody else, if my love for one
person makes me more alienated and distant from my fellow man, I may be
attached to this person in any number of ways, yet I do not love.  If I can
say, 'I love you,' I say, 'I love you in you also myself.'  Self-love, in
this sense, is the opposite of selfishness.  The latter is actually a greedy
concern with oneself which springs from and compensates for the lack of
genuine love for oneself.  Love, paradoxically, makes me more independent
because it makes me stronger and happier--yet it makes me one with the
loved person to the extent that individuality seems to be extinguished for
the moment.  In loving I experience 'I am you,' you-the loved person,
you-the stranger, you-everything alive.  In the experience of love lies the
only answer to being human, lies sanity.

    Seeing is of course indispensable to learning, particularly in
science, which is of the eye.  Visual aids therefore have a place in the
laboratory.  And most students, not being future scientists, will learn
more from good films of important experiments than from their own fumbling
attempts.  But sometimes they must fumble too, and have a teacher who
fumbles on occasion, and thinks all the time he is in class.  One learns
not by a photographic copying of things shown, but by an internal drama
imitative of the action witnessed.  When the instructor gropes for a word,
corrects himself, interjects a comment or an analogy not directly called
for, he gives a spectacle of man thinking which no slick film or televised
show will provide.
  -- Jacques Barzun, from "Science: The Glorious Entertainment", 1964
~
    Far from behaving (or should one say behavioring?) with the regular
intelligibility of a clock, the bent of the living and of man in particular
is to MISbehave, in all senses of the word--from developing allergies,
which make poison out of delicacies, to committing crimes which, as in
saints and statesman, can later seem the highest wisdom.  It is even proved
by research that man must have his ration of dreaming, that is, of
irregular and inaccurate thinking.  These facts of experience require that
any science of the regularities of behavior be always qualified and
admonished by another discipline, a learned lore of misbehavior.

    I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front
only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had
to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  I did
not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to
practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.  I wanted to live deep
and suck out all of the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartanlike
as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave
close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and,
if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of
it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it
by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.

    The Mind has a different relish, as well as the Palate; and you will
as fruitlessly endeavour to delight all Men with Riches or Glory, (which yet
some Men place their Happiness in,) as you would to satisfie all Men's
Hunger with Cheese or Lobsters; which though very agreeable and delicious
fare to some, are to others extremely nauseous and offensive: And many
People would with Reason prefer the griping of an hungry Belly, to those
Dishes, which are a Feast to others.  Hence it was, I think, that the
Philosophers of old did in vain enquire, whether Summum bonum (the chief
good) consisted in Riches, or bodily Delights, or Virtue, or Contemplation:
And they might have as reasonably disputed, whether the best Relish were to
be found in Apples, Plumbs, or Nuts; and have divided themselves into Sects
upon it.  For as pleasant Tastes depend not on the things themselves, but
their agreeableness to this or that particulate Palate, wherein there is
great variety:  So the greatest Happiness consists, in the having those
things which produce the greatest Pleasure, and the absence of those which
cause any disturbance, any pain, which to different Men are very different
things.  If therefore Men in this Life only have hope; if in this Life they
can only enjoy, 'tis not strange, nor unreasonable, they should seek their
Happiness by avoiding all things that disease them here, and by preferring
all that delight them; wherein it will be no wonder to find variety and
difference.  For if there be no Prospect beyond the Grave, the inference is
certainly right, Let us eat and drink, let us enjoy what we delight in, for
to morrow we shall die.  This, I think, may serve to shew us the Reason,
why, though all Men's desires tend to Happiness, yet they are not moved by
the same Object.  Men may chuse different things, and yet all chuse right,
supposing them only like a Company of poor Insects, whereof some are Bees,
delighted with Flowers, and their sweetness; others, Bettles, delighted with
other kinds of Viands;  which having enjoyed for a Season, they should cease
to be, and exist no more for ever.

    Even if something new does not require a disruption of the old, there
is no space.  People, time and resources are fully stretched -- in many
cases there is actually a cutting-back in resources.
    The paradox is that as we advance into the future the need for change
gets greater and greater (to cope with changes in population, pollution,
etc., and to make full use of our new technologies) but the possibility of
change gets less and less because everything is already committed.
    A wise general does not commit all his troops but keeps a strategic
reserve which can be used as the need and opportunity arise.  Society does
not do this, because we believe that we have all the bases covered and that
progress will come about through evolution, the clash of opinions and the
occasional lone innovator.
    In addition to allocating funds to research, most successful
corporations also allocate funds to new business divisions or venture
groups.  Like the strategic reserves of a general, these groups are outside
the day-to-day combat and are looking for new opportunities.
    Democracy could not easily tolerate this principle of strategic
reserve, for the unallocated resources would be the target of every
department or issue that felt it was under-funded.  Emergency funds do
exist, but not space and resources for change.
    The same thing applies on the thinking level.  A person who knows all
the answers, has an opinion on everything, has a certainty backed up by
rational argument, has very little possibility of further progress.  Such a
person is unlikely to walk away from a discussion with anything more than a
reaffirmation of how right he or she has been all along.

    The pleasantest time of day here is at sunset.  Then accompanied by
some fifteen girls and little children I walk through the village to the end
of Siufaga, where we stand on an iron bound point and watch the waves splash
us in the face, while the sun goes down, over the sea and at the same time
behind the cocoanut covered hills.  Most of the adult population is going
into the sea to bathe, clad in lavalavas with buckets for water borne along
on shoulder poles.  All the heads of families are seated in the fatele
(village guesthouse) making kava.  At one point a group of women are filling
a small canoe with a solution of native starch (arrowroot).  And perhaps,
just as we reach the store, the curfew-angelus will stop us, a wooden bell
will clang mellowly through the village.  The children must all scurry to
cover, if we're near the store, it's the store steps, and sit tight until
the bell sounds again.  Prayer is over.  Sometimes we are all back safely in
room when the bell sounds, and then the Lord's Prayer must be said in
English, while flowers are all taken out of their hair and the siva song
stopped in the middle.  But once the bell sounds again, solemnity, never of
a very reliable depth, is sloughed off, the flowers replaced in the girls'
hair, the siva song replaces the hymn, and they begin to dance, by no means
in a puritan fashion.  Their supper comes about eight and sometimes I have a
breathing spell, but usually the supper hours don't jibe well enough for
that.  They dance for me a great deal, they love it and it is an excellent
index to temperament, as the dance is so individualistic, and the audience
think it is its business to keep up incessant comment.

    Recently one of us was leading a group of thirty Western
businesspeople through Japan to learn about Japanese management techniques.
We took the bullet train from Hiroshima to Osaka, and since the train
stopped for only twenty seconds in Hiroshima, it would have been impossible
to get all the executives and their luggage on the train at the same time.
So we hired a trucking company and crew to transfer the luggage separately.
The crew removed all luggage from each individual's room in Hiroshima and
placed it in his pre-checked room in another chain's hotel in Osaka.  Can
you imagine doing that in the United States and ever seeing your luggage
again?
    One of the executives, thinking his shoes were too worn, had discarded
them in the wastepaper basket in his Hiroshima hotel room.  Imagine his shock
when he entered his room in Osaka and saw his old shoes carefully laid in
the wastepaper basket there.  Was the Japanese trucking company politely
saying that these shoes still had life and should yet be thrown away, or was
the company accommodating a crazy foreigner who liked to keep his shoes in
the wastepaper basket?  Either way, the company was organized for highly
intelligent service at every level.

    The term 'information' appears to cover too much that seems
distinctive: knowledge, data, information in a narrow sense that some treat
as synonymous with data, news, intelligence, and numerous other colloquial
and specialized denotations and connotations.  However, the distinctions
implied by oppositions such as observations/theories, data/knowledge, raw
intelligence/finished intelligence, accounting details/management are
secondary, not fundamental, in characterizing information resources.  They
reflect only relative judgments.  For instance, one person's knowledge is
often another's raw data.  What a vice president for marketing, production,
or finance thinks he knows is just data to the chief executive officer's
staff.  What a scientist thinks he knows about the merits of a flu vaccine
or the safety of a nuclear reactor is just data for presidential policy and
politics.  Data or knowledge are just types of information content--of
greater or lesser value, of greater or lesser cost.
  -- Anthony Oettinger, from "The Information Resources Policy Handbook"

    Given the fact that there seems to be a fundamental willingness to
accept the machine as almost human, the issue of what type of relationship
is possible seems to center around what friendship-cues might be
artificially generated.  Appearance and voice quality could certainly be
tailored so that the machine would look and sound attractive and friendly.
The software could be written to suggest an interesting and unique
personality, and the conversational style might appear as humorous and
good-natured.  The machine would not only impress us with its intelligence
and knowledge of the world, but would also convey the impression that it
was warm and understanding.  Its ability to integrate our interests and
attitudes into its own framework and its willingness to be influenced by
our point of view would also enhance our respect for the machine.  The fact
that it appeared to take our opinions seriously might be regarded as a
compliment, and it is clear that if we are prepared to accept compliments
from a computer then we are implicitly accepting it as a social agent.
    Friendships are not made in a day, and the computer would be more
acceptable as a friend if it simulated the gradual changes that occur when
one person is getting to know another.  At an appropriate time it might
also express the endearment that stimulates attachment and intimacy.  The
whole process would be accomplished with subtlety to avoid giving an
impression of overfamiliarity or ingratiation, which would be likely to
produce irritation or animosity.  After experiencing a wealth of powerful,
well-timed indicators, the user would be likely to accept the computer as
far more than a machine and might well come to regard it as a friend.

    By this time the stars were moving out of the Hollywood Hotel and

them unlimited power and instant wealth, is bound to produce a lively and

    The four years passed at college were, for his purposes, wasted.
Harvard College was a good school, but at bottom what the boy
disliked most was any school at all.  He did not want to be one in a
hundred -- one percent of an education.  He regarded himself as the
only person for whom his education had value, and he wanted the whole
of it.  He got barely half of an average.
    Long afterwards, when the devious path of life led him back to
teach in his turn what no student naturally cared or needed to know
[medieval history], he diverted some dreary hours of faculty meetings
by looking up his record in the class-lists, and found himself graded
precisely in the middle.  In the one branch he most needed --
mathematics -- barring the few first scholars, failure was so nearly
universal that no attempt at grading could have had value, and
whether he stood fortieth or ninetieth must have been an accident or
the personal favor of the professor.  Here his education failed
lamentably.  At best he could never have been a mathematician; at
worst he would never have cared to be one; but he needed to read
mathematics, like any other universal language, and he never reached
the alphabet.
  -- Henry Adams, from "The Education of Henry Adams"

    The pedagogical method of observation has for its base the liberty of
the child; and liberty is activity.
    Discipline must come through liberty.  Here is a great principle which
is difficult for followers of common-school methods to understand.  How
shall one obtain discipline in a class of free children?  Certainly in our
system, we have a concept of discipline very different from that commonly
accepted.  If discipline is founded upon liberty, consider an individual
disciplined only when he has been rendered as artificially silent as a mute
and as immovable as a paralytic.  He is an individual annihilated, not
disciplined.
    We call an individual disciplined when he is master of himself, and
can, therefore, regulate his own conduct when it shall be necessary to
follow some rule of life.  Such a concept of active discipline is not easy
either to comprehend or to apply.  But certainly it contains a great
educational principle, very different from the old-time absolute and
undiscussed coercion to immobility.

    A company could conceivably have within it a monastery-style unit
that writes software...  a research team organized like an improvisational
jazz combo...  a compartmentalized spy-network, with need-to-know rules,
operating within the law, to scout for merger or acquisition
possibilities...  and a sales force organized as a highly motivated 'tribe'
complete with its own war songs and emotional membership rituals.
    ...(T)he units of a flex-firm may draw information, people, and money
from one another and from outside organizations as needed.  They may be next
door to one another or continents apart.  Their functions may partly
overlap, like information in a hyper-media data base; for other purposes,
the functions may be logically, geographically, or financially divided.
Some may use many central services provided by headquarters; others may
choose to use only a few.
    In turn this requires freer, faster flows of information.  This will
mean crisscrossing, up, down, and sideways conduits--neural pathways that
bust through the boxes in the table of organization so that people can trade
the ideas, data, formulae, hints, insights, facts, strategies, whispers,
gesture, and smiles that turn out to be essential to efficiency.

Here in the newspaper business, we have definitely caught Internet Fever.
In the old days, we used to -- get this! -- actually CHARGE MONEY for our
newspapers.  Ha!  What an old-fashioned, low-tech, non-digital concept!
Nowadays all of the modern newspapers spend millions of dollars operating
Web sites where we give away the entire newspaper for free.  Sometimes we
run advertisements in the regular newspaper urging our paying customers to
go to our Web sites instead.  'Stop giving us money!' is the shrewd marketing
thrust of these ads.  Why do we do this?  Because all the other newspapers
are doing it!  This is called 'market penetration.'

    A highly competitive person has a hard row to hoe.  There is no
satisfaction in winning a competition unless it is a stiff and fair one.
Stiff is easy to define; it is stiff if one's own realistic assessment of
one's abilities make the odds long--the longer the odds, the greater
satisfaction on winning.  Fair is harder to define, for if one wins a
contest against long odds, there must be a reason.  The odds weren't really
long; they only appeared to be so.  Isn't it unfair to appear to be an
underdog when one really isn't?  Let's start with some obvious distinctions:
A professional gambler needs to win in order to earn his living.  Fairness
is not his concern.  He tries to be unfair in various ways: Keeping cards up
his sleeve is one way that the rest of us universally deplore; the morality
of concealing his skill to attract dupes is hardly less questionable.
Fairness means at least an honest deal (no hidden cards) and no intentional
concealment of one's abilities.

    The United States is trying to promote democracy around the
world and holds itself up as a model.  However, it is obvious that
our democracy has been reduced to charisma and money.
    Surely intelligent and conscientious citizens can make wise and
informed decisions?  I for one cannot...  I do not know anyone who
spends more hours than I do in search of information and wisdom, yet
it avails me little.  Many people with power spend much of their time
flying around the world, being wined and dined, but that means they
have little time to do their homework.
    Is the idea of democracy based on an informed electorate just a dream?

     International Studies).

    When there is communication without need for communication,
merely so that someone may earn the social and intellectual prestige
of becoming a priest of communication, the quality and communicative
value of the message drop like a plummet...  In the arts, the desire
to find new things to say and new ways of saying them is the source
of all life and interest.  Yet every day we meet with examples of
painting where, for instance, the artist has bound himself from the
new canons of the abstract, and has displayed no intention to use these
canons to display an interesting and novel form of beauty, to pursue
the uphill fight against the prevailing tendency toward the commonplace
and the banal...
    I speak here with feeling which is more intense as far as concerns
the scientific artist than the conventional artist, because it is in
science that I have first chosen to say something.  What sometimes
enrages me and always disappoints and grieves me is the preference of
great schools of learning for the derivative as opposed to the original,
for the conventional and thin which can be duplicated in many copies
rather than the new and powerful, and for arid correctness and
limitation of scope and method rather than for universal newness and
beauty, wherever it may be seen.

    Please do not suppose that the only function of puzzles is to entertain.
Puzzles are a way of teaching mathematics.  Indeed, they are the best way to
teach it.  Fred Hoyle, the famous British astronomer who taught mathematics
at Cambridge University for twenty years states in strong terms his belief
that mathematics should never be 'taught' at all.  Students must learn for
themselves.  How?  By solving puzzles.  The functions of the teacher should
be, first, to select in a wise way the material on which the puzzles are
based, second, to make sure the puzzles are well suited in difficulty to the
sophistication of the student, third, to answer questions, and finally, if
the teacher is capable of it, to give an occasional word of inspiration.

In the sciences, hypothesis always precedes law, which is to say, there is
always a lot of tall guessing before a new fact is established.  The
guessers are often quite as important as the fact-finders; in truth, it
would not be difficult to argue that they are more important.  New facts are
seldom plucked from the clear sky; they have to be approached and smelled
out by a process of trial and error, in which bold and shrewd guessing is an
integral part.  The Greeks were adept at such guessing, and the scientists
of the world have been following the leads they opened for more than two
thousand years.

It astonishes me to find... [that so many] of our countrymen...
should be contented to live under a system which leaves to their
governors the power of taking from them the trial by jury in
civil cases, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom
of commerce, the habeas corpus laws, and of yoking them with a
standing army.  This is a degeneracy in the principles of
liberty... which I [would not have expected for at least] four
centuries.

By a declaration of rights, I mean one which shall stipulate
freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of commerce
against monopolies, trial by juries in all cases, no suspensions
of the habeas corpus, no standing armies.  These are fetters
against doing evil which no honest government should decline.

[Of the Romans...]
Is not a certain dullness their most visible characteristic?
What is the history of their speculative mind? -- a blank.
What their literature? -- a copy.  They have left not a single
discovery in any abstract science; not a single perfect or
well-formed work of high imagination.  The Greeks, the perfection
of narrow and accomplished genius, bequeathed to mankind the ideal
forms of self-idolizing art -- the Romans imitated and admired;
the Greeks explained the laws of nature -- the Romans wondered and
despised; the Greeks invented a system of numerals second only to
that now in use -- the Romans counted to the end of their days
with the clumsy apparatus which we still call by their name; the
Greeks made a capital and scientific calendar -- the Romans began
their month when the Pontifex Maximus happened to spy out the new
moon.  Throughout Latin literature, this is the perpetual puzzle
-- Why are we free and they slaves?  we praetors and they barbers?
Why do the stupid people always win, and the clever people always
lose?

    Every good teacher has his own special art; with some, it is a genius
for a clarity that sometimes is more lucid than the complexities of the
subject justify.  Sometimes it is a talent for apothegm or leading
suggestion, a word that evokes a vista or an idea that opens a world.  I
cannot now quite remember what Professor Beard's special technique was.  He
was clear, he was suggestive, he was witty.  But none of these things could
quite account for the hold he had on the smug and the rebels alike, on both
the pre-lawyers and pre-poets.  I suspect it was a certain combination of
poetry, philosophy, and honesty in the man himself, a sense he communicated
that politics mattered far beyond the realm commonly called political, and
an insight he conveyed into the life that forms of government furthered or
betrayed.  One morning he came into class as usual, stood against the wall,
and half-closing his eyes, said:
    "Gentlemen, today we are to discuss the budget system in State
government.  I am sure that must seem to you a dull subject.  But if you will
tell me, gentlemen, how much per capita a nation spends on its Army, on its
Navy, on education, on public works, I shall be able to tell you, I think,
as much about that nation as if you gave me the works of its poets and
philosophers."
    We listened with revised and revived attention to an exposition, full
of figures and detail, of the State budget system.  Charles A. Beard showed
us what politics had to do with the life beyond it and which it made
possible.  And he taught us, too, the difference between the forms of
government and the living substance of its operations...  Nobody who has ever
listened to Beard can disdain the study of politics in favor of the study of
"higher things".  He has been too well taught, as tragic world events have
since shown, how government may nourish or destroy "higher things".

    The technologies which have had the most profound effects on human life
are usually simple.  A good example of a simple technology with profound
historical consequences is hay.  Nobody knows who invented hay, the idea of
cutting grass in the autumn and storing it in large enough quantities to
keep horses and cows alive through the winter.  All we know is that the
technology of hay was unknown to the Roman Empire but was known to every
village of medieval Europe.  Like many other crucially important
technologies, hay emerged anonymously during the so-called Dark Ages.
According to the Hay Theory of History, the invention of hay was the
decisive event which moved the center of gravity of urban civilization from
the Mediterranean basin to Northern and Western Europe.  The Roman Empire did
not need hay because in a Mediterranean climate the grass grows well enough
in winter for animals to graze.  North of the Alps, great cities dependent on
horses and oxen for motive power could not exist without hay.  So it was hay
that allowed populations to grow and civilization to flourish among the
forests of Northern Europe.  Hay moved the greatness of Rome to Paris and
London, and later to Berlin and Moscow and New York.

Professional work of any sort tends to narrow the mind, to limit the point
of view, and to put a hallmark on a man of a most unmistakable kind.  On the
one hand are the intense, ardent natures, absorbed in their studies and
quickly losing interest in everything but their profession, while other
faculties and interest 'fust' unused.  On the other hand are the bovine
brethren, who think of nothing but the treadmill and the corn.  From very
different causes, the one from concentration, the other from apathy, both
are apt to neglect those outside studies that widen the sympathies and help
a man to get the best there is out of life...  the medical man, perhaps more
than any other man, needs that higher education of which Plato speaks,
'that education in virtue from youth upwards, which enables a man to pursue
the ideal perfection.'  It is not for all, nor can all attain it, but there
is comfort and help in the pursuit, even though the end is never reached.

    Scientific research is solving puzzles.  The pleasure to
be got from it is the pleasure of the crossword or jig-saw addict.
First the blank diagram, or the scatter of meaningless pieces; then
an occasional tentative clue or the few pieces of the same colour
that seem to fit together; next a period of frustration, going over
and over the list of clues, or trying piece after piece in the most
unlikely conjunctions; then--ah the sweet joy of the word that
completes a doubtful acrostic, or the section that springs to life
as a tree, or a house or a pot of flowers; finally, the completion
of the pattern, with clue after clue solved in rapid succession, or
the last few pieces tumbling into place.  By accepting the challenge,
the tension, the concentration, the frustration, we heighten the
pleasure of the moment or revelation.  The more difficult the puzzle,
the greater the tension--and so much greater the delights of solution.

At this point I reveal myself in my true colours, as a stick-in-the-mud.
I hold a number of beliefs that have been repudiated by the liveliest
intellects of our time.  I believe that order is better than chaos,
creation better than destruction.  I prefer gentleness to violence,
forgiveness to vendetta.  On the whole I think that knowledge is
preferable to ignorance, and I am sure that human sympathy is more
valuable than ideology.  I believe that in spite of the recent triumphs
of science, men haven't changed much in the last two thousand years; and
in consequence we must still try to learn from history.  History is
ourselves.  I also hold one or two beliefs that are more difficult to put
shortly.  For example, I believe in courtesy, the ritual by which we
avoid hurting other people's feelings by satisfying our own egos.  And I
think we should remember that we are part of a great whole, which for
convenience we call nature.  All living things are our brothers and
sisters.  Above all, I believe in the God-given genius of certain
individuals, and I value a society that makes their existence possible.

We will take almost any kind of criticism except the observation that
we have no sense of humor.  A man will admit to being a coward, a liar, a

he has a dreadful sense of humor and you might as well have slandered his
mother.  Even if he is civilized enough to pretend to make light of your
statement, he will still secretly believe that he has, not only a good
sense of humor, but one superior to most.  This is all the more surprising
when you consider that not one person in a million can give you any kind of

    School curricula reinforce the impression that logical subjects like math
and science require starting with basics and progressively adding more
sophisticated conclusions and applications.  But the very nature of logical
laws make it equally feasible to work backward from conclusions, or
observations, to hypotheses.  Deduction and induction are entirely
complementary.
    In reality, scientists and mathematicians do not do their crafts in the
linear, progressive way their subjects are usually taught.  Practitioners
commonly start with a flash of insight (the stereotypical light bulb lighting),
a hunch, a dream, a guess, an elaborate hypothesis or postulate, and then work
backward, forward, and around it to try to make it fit with established
knowledge.  Physicists or engineers commonly try using complex mathematical
gadgets to solve the problems that interest them without knowing or caring how
the math was logically derived.  Experimenters tinker in laboratories and make
surprising discoveries that theoreticians then labor to try to explain
logically.  Alternatively, theorists like Einstein come up with wild new
theories like relativity that experiments may have to struggle for decades to
find a way to test and prove.  Scientific knowledge does not grow incrementally
down a predictable track.  Rather it grows volcanolike, sometimes oozing in
patient rivulets, sometimes erupting in fiery ferment, and occasionally
exploding, blowing away the rock of established truth.
    Pedantic, linear teaching rarely conveys the true drama and mystery of the
human quest for knowledge.  School plods where human imagination naturally
leaps.

the people who are the most in need of help are often the
same ones who cannot receive it.  for example, those who
believe all human minds are isolated and who have built their
lives on that principle can only rarely come to appreciate the
connections between us.  their loneliness and self-imposed
isolation seems to be the normal state of affairs to these
people; little do they realize that if they relaxed their
armored ego barrier, then the thoughts and emotions of others
would start to be perceptible.  they desperately cling to the
belief system that IS their problem in such a way that they
cannot see the solution, nor can they even believe that the
solution exists.  should these people consciously strive to
relax that barrier, it would dissolve quickly.  many just
cannot do that and never will.  many can however, and can
relax in the invisible web of human mentation that underlies
all of our consciousnesses like a huge, comfortable and active
safety net.

    Attempts to mimic the mind of man are as yet in their infancy.
The road, however, is open, and it conjures up thoughts which are
exciting but also in some ways frightening.  What if man eventually
were to produce a mechanical creature, with or without organic
parts, equal or superior to himself in all respects, including
intelligence and creativity?  Would it replace man, as the superior
organisms of the earth have replaced or subordinated the less well-
adapted in the long history of evolution?
    It is a queasy thought: that we represent, for the first time
in the history of life on the earth, a species capable of bringing
about its own possible replacement.  Of course, we have it in our
power to prevent such a regrettable denouement by refusing to build
machines that are too intelligent.  But it is tempting to build them
nevertheless.  What achievement could be grander than the creation
of an object that surpasses the creator?  How could we consummate
the victory of intelligence over nature more gloriously than by
passing on our heritage, in triumph, to a greater intelligence--of
our own making?

The closer that journalism has approached the standing of an
authentic profession, oddly enough, the less attractive its
individual practitioners appear to have become in the public
mind.  This irony is traceable in large measure to the
distinguished work of the press in its persistent recording
of the futility and manifold injustices of the Vietnam War and
its disclosures in the Watergate scandal.  Those protracted
traumas scarred the national psyche, which in turn found
solace by blaming the press for battening on the troubles it
apparently delighted in reporting.  Reporters came to be seen
as arrogant in the conduct of their duties, habitually
adversarial in posture, often insensitive, and unapologetic
about substituting their own right to demand the truth for the
public's right not to be stalked ruthlessly like so much grist
for the milling of tomorrow's headlines.  This impression has
been deepened by the coarseness of television news, which is
essentially a headline service trading on its emotional graphic
appeal and dealing so superficially with events and so rarely
with the complex issues behind them that its effect is to
divert rather than to inform; TV remains primarily an
entertainment medium that has not challenged the role of
newspapers as the prime recorders of the community's serious
business.  But because we see television correspondents
questioning the President or putting it to the police chief,
they become personalities in their own right, far more imposing
than a faceless byline over a printed story.

culture, economic and technological power, and a total affirmation of

    During the last three decades, neuroscientists throughout the world
have probed the nervous system in fascinating detail and have learned a
great deal about the laws of mental life and about how these laws emerge
from the brain.  The pace of progress has been exhilarating, but--at the
same time--the findings make many people uncomfortable.  It seems somehow
disconcerting to be told that your life, all your hopes, triumphs and
aspirations simply arise from the activity of neurons in your brain.  But
far from being humiliating, this idea is ennobling, I think.
    Science--cosmology, evolution and especially the brain sciences--is
telling us that we have no privileged position in the universe and that our
sense of having a private nonmaterial soul "watching the world" is really an
illusion (as has long been emphasized by Eastern mystical traditions like
Hinduism and Zen Buddhism).  Once you realize that far from being a
spectator, you are in fact part of the eternal ebb and flow of events in the
cosmos, this realization is very liberating.  Ultimately this idea also
allows you to cultivate a certain humility--the essence of all authentic
religious experience.

Scientists, who nearly always speak extemporaneously in public
presentations, note that humanists almost always read papers
at professional meetings, and rarely show slides--except for
art historians, who always use two screens simultaneously--even
for the most visual subjects.  Why, 'we' ask, do 'they' not
realize that written and spoken English are different languages,
and that very few people can read well in public--a particular
irony since humanists supposedly hold language as their primary
tool of professional competence.  But 'they,' on the other hand,
rightly ridicule 'our' tendencies to darken a lecture room even
before we reach the podium and to rely almost entirely upon a
string of pictures thereafter.  A stale joke proclaims that if
Galileo had first presented the revolutionary results of Siderius
Nuncius as a modern scientific talk, his opening line could only
have been: 'first slide please.'

    Futurology is a fashion.  The approach of the end of the current
millennium has stimulated it.  But it looks like a fashion in decline.  It
seems to have peaked when public interest in the future was enlivened by
debate between scientific perfectibilians and apocalyptic visionaries.  The
optimists predicted a world made easy by progress, lives prolonged by
medical wizardry, wealth made universal by the alchemy of economic growth,
society rectified by the egalitarianism of technologically prolonged
leisure.  The pessimists foresaw nuclear immolation or population explosion
or a purgative world revolution -- a cosmic struggle reminiscent of the
millennium of Christian prophetic tradition -- which would either save or
enslave mankind.
    No one gets excited by such visions today.  Scientific progress has
been, at best, disappointing -- encumbering us with apparently insoluble
social and moral problems, or else, at worst, alarming -- threatening us
with the mastery of artificially intelligent machines or genetically
engineered human mutants.  Economic growth has become the bogey of the
ecologically anxious.  Meanwhile, world revolution and the nuclear holocaust
have been postponed, and apocalyptic prophecy has resorted to forebodings --
variously unconvincing or uncompelling -- about ecological cataclysms.
Proliferation of nuclear weapons and the discovery that even peaceful
nuclear installations can poison great parts of the world has, in some ways,
made disaster impend more darkly; but lingering extinction and little local
nuclear holocausts seem to lack, in public esteem the glamour of a sudden
and comprehensive armageddon.  The future has become depressing rather than
dramatic, and futurology has lost allure.

    Civility will always have its critics.  In 1997, when New York's
chief judge proposed rules requiring lawyers on opposing sides to be civil
to each other, the prominent divorce lawyer Raoul Felder wrote a caustic
response in the New York Times.  "If lawyers truly care about the causes
they represent, they should, on occasion, get hot under the collar, raise
their voices, become pugnacious," he wrote.  Conflict, argued Felder, is
what the legal profession is about.  Civility, he concluded, "may not always
be the right reaction in an adversarial courtroom."
    This argument reminds me of the commentary by Ed Rollins that it
was his job to diminish the reputation of his client's opponent.  Nastiness,
in other words, is not merely the option but the responsibility of the
political profession.  The legal profession too: "I have never heard a
client complain that his or her lawyer was rude," Felder tells us.  In both
cases, law and politics, rudeness is evidently justified on the ground that
rudeness is what the client is paying for.
    As any student of civility would, I find this a fascinating notion:
that there are professions for which incivility is a requirement.  I suppose
I disbelieve it; or, rather, if there are such professions, I am skeptical
of their morality, because they fail to convey a message that we are, all of
us, not lone drivers but fellow passengers.  It may be that law and politics
seem so dismally rude because their principal ethic is merely one of
victory, an ethic materially enriching and emotionally satisfying, but
morally unimportant.  If lawyers are paid to be rude and political
consultants to be nasty, and if their incivility is linked to the fact that
they are also paid to win, we should scarcely be surprised that professional
athletes find it comfortable to brawl with fans, spit on umpires, take bites

    Newspapers have changed their character during my lifetime.  They used
to be the principal carriers of the world's news, but television holds that
position now.  Television, however, has serious limitations; it is a visual
medium, and it is dominated by the principle that nothing is news unless you
can take a picture of it.  It is here that the newspapers still hold their
own; so much of what goes on in the political world cannot be effectively
photographed; statesmen, in their expensive but uninteresting clothes, make
very poor TV and their prolonged deliberations are dull when we see them on
the box.  Politics must be interpreted, and newspapers have become their
untiring interpreters...  Intelligence, not perhaps on its highest level
but far beyond the sheer emotionalism of TV, has found its refuge in the
newspapers.

    Despite the incorporated homicide or suicide called war, despite the
crimes of individuals, the natural conflicts of domestic parties and
national ambitions, I believe, after fifty years of studying history,
that man is physically, mentally, and morally better, on the average,
than at any time in the past; that our poverty, so disgraceful amid our
unprecedented wealth, is not so shameless as the slavery that supported
an enfranchised minority in Periclean Athens or Augustan Rome; that our
marital chaos and moral laxity are no worse than in the England of
Charles II or the France of Louis XV; that more good books are being
published than ever before and more widely read; and that art will soon
rise to a new level of self-discipline and social significance.
    I mourn the ugly slums of our cities and the distress of those who
cannot find work for their hands to do; but I see realized around me,
in an unparalleled proportion of our people, such a spread of home
ownership, family income, physical comforts, educational opportunities,
political freedom, and scientific powers as would amaze and gladden our
Founding Fathers if they could return to see what their progeny and
their institutions have done...  This time, this moment, is as good as
any that ever was, and is incomparably more wonderful.

    One of the interesting features of communication is that, broadly
speaking, to be perceived, information must reside in more than one context.
We know what something is by contrast with what it is not.  Silence makes
musical notes perceivable; conversation is understood as a contrast of
contexts, speaker and hearer; words, breaks and breaths.  In turn, in order
to be meaningful, these contexts of information must be relinked through
some sort of judgment of equivalence or comparability.  This occurs at all
levels of scale, and we all do it routinely as part of everyday life.
    None of this is new in theories of information and communication: we
have long had models of signals and targets, background, noise and filters,
signals, and quality controls.  We are moving this insight here to the level
of social interaction.  People often cannot see what they take for granted
until they encounter someone who does not take it for granted.

    The most fruitful and natural exercise of the mind, in my opinion, is
conversation.  I find the use of it more sweet than of any other action of
life; and for that reason it is that, if I were now compelled to choose, I
should sooner, I think, consent to lose my sight, than my hearing and
speech...  The study of books is a languishing and feeble motion that heats
not, whereas conversation teaches and exercises at once.  If I converse with
an understanding man, and a rough disputant, he presses hard upon me and
pricks me on both sides; his imaginations raise up mine to more than
ordinary pitch; jealousy, glory, and contention, stimulate and raise me up
to something above my self...

    Like cars over the years, computers are getting easier to use, and in
some respects the changes are analogous to the placement of gauges by idiot
lights.  And, like drivers who favor gauges, some computer users belittle the
trend toward easy-to-use systems.  These users appear to thrive on
complexity.  They are often experts who enjoy getting the most out of their
computers; they view computing as an end rather than a means.
    Unlike cars, easy-to-use computers aren't called idiot-proof, they're
called user-friendly.  As a marketing achievement, this terminology ranks
with 'Palmetto bugs,' which is a term used in Florida-at the instigation of
some genius in the real estate industry, I'm told-for large, flying
cockroaches."

    Ads manipulate us into being dissatisfied...  We are encouraged to feel
anxious or sorry for ourselves.  Advertising teaches us to live on the level
of the pleasure principle.  This leads to impulse-control problems and to
feelings of entitlement.  "I am the center of the universe and I want what I
want now."  This thinking creates citizens who are vulnerable to quick fixes.
It leads to citizens filled with self-pity, which is the flip side of
entitlement.
    Advertising teaches that people shouldn't have to suffer, that pain
is unnatural and can be cured.  They say that effort is bad and convenience
is good and that products solve complex human problems.  Over and over people
hear that their needs for love, security and variety can be met with
products.  They may reject the message of any particular ad, but over time
many buy the big message -- buying products is important.

    All those who succeed in America -- no matter what their circle of
origin or their sphere of action -- are likely to become involved in the
world of the celebrity...  This world has not been built from below, as a
slow and steady linking of local societies and metropolitan 400s.  It has
been created from above...  With the incorporation of the economy, the
ascendancy of the military establishment, and the centralization of the
enlarged state, there have arisen the national elite, who, in occupying the
command posts of the big hierarchies, have taken the spotlight of publicity
and become subjects of the intensive build-up.  At the same time, with the
elaboration of the national means of mass communication, the professional
celebrities of the entertainment world have come fully and continuously into
the national view.  As personalities of national glamour, they are at the
focal point of all the means of entertainment and publicity.  Both the
metropolitan 400 and the institutional elite must now compete with and
borrow prestige from these professionals in the world of the celebrity.
    But what are the celebrities?  The celebrities are The Names that
need no further identification.  Those who know them so far exceed those of
whom they know as to require no exact computation.  Wherever the celebrities
go, they are recognized, and moreover, recognized with some excitement and
awe.  Whatever they do has publicity value.  More or less continuously, over a
period of time, they are the material for the media of communication and
entertainment.  And, when that time ends -- as it must -- and the celebrity
still lives -- as he may -- from time to time it may be asked, "Remember
him?" That is what celebrity means.

    We generally think of music as a product of art rather than commerce
or technology.  It depends, in fact, on all three.  Together, these great
dynamic systems match individual creativity and individual desire.  They
thus generate change, variety and an endless array of critics--all
determined that music, like the rest of society, should conform to
"one best way".
    That would be a terrible deal.  By tolerating music that pleases
others but not ourselves, we preserve a system that has delivered a
historical wonder...  We can listen to perfectly performed music to suit
any mood or taste at any time, music that moves us in ways particular to our
individual senses and our individual souls.

    Today, when man seems to have reached the beginning of a new,
richer, happier human era, his existence and that of the generations to
follow is more threatened than ever.  How is this possible?
    Man had won his freedom from clerical and secular authorities, he
stood alone with his reason and his conscience as his only judges, but he
was afraid of the newly won freedom; he had achieved 'freedom from' --
without yet having achieved 'freedom to' -- to be himself, to be productive,
to be fully awake.  Thus he tried to escape from freedom.  His very
achievement, the mastery over nature, opened up the avenue for his escape.
    In building the new industrial machine, men became so absorbed in
the new task that it became the paramount goal of his life.  His energies,
which once were devoted to the search for God and salvation, were now
directed toward the domination of nature and ever-increasing material
comfort.  He ceased to use production as a means for a better life, but
hypostatized it instead to an end in itself, an end to which life was
subordinated.  In the process of an ever-increasing size of social
agglomerations, man himself became a part of the machine, rather than its
master.  He experienced himself as a commodity, as an investment; his aim
became to be a success, that is, to sell himself as profitably as possible
on the market.  His value as a person lies in his salability, not in his
human qualities of love, reason or in his artistic capacities.  Happiness
becomes identical with consumption of newer and better commodities, the
drinking in of music, screen plays, fun, sex, liquor and cigarettes.  Not
having a sense of self except the one which conformity with the majority can
give, he is insecure, anxious, depending on approval.  He is alienated from
himself, worships the product of his own hands, the leaders of his own
making, as if they were above him, rather than made by him.  He is in a
sense back where he was before the great human evolution began in the second
millennium B.C.

choad /chohd/ /n./
  Synonym for 'penis' used in alt.tasteless and popularized by the denizens
thereof.  They say: "We think maybe it's from Middle English but we're all
too damned lazy to check the OED." [I'm not.  It isn't.  --ESR]
  This term is alleged to have been inherited through 1960s underground
comics, and to have been recently sighted in the Beavis and Butthead

confirmed that `choad' is in fact an Indian vernacular word equivalent
to `f*ck'; it is therefore likely to have entered English slang via the
British Raj.

    For decades, people have warned that pervasive databanks and
surveillance technology are leading inevitably to the death of privacy and
democracy.  But these days, many people who hear the word 'privacy' think
about those kooks living off in the woods with their shotguns: these folks
get their mail at post office boxes registered under assumed names, grow
their own food, use cash to buy what they can't grow for themselves, and
constantly worry about being attacked by the federal government-or by space
aliens.  If you are not one of these people, you may well ask, "Why should I
worry about my privacy?  I have nothing to hide."
    The problem with this word 'privacy' is that it falls short of
conveying the really big picture.  Privacy isn't just about hiding things.
It's about self-possession, autonomy, and integrity.  As we move into the
computerized world of the twenty-first century, privacy will be one of our
most important civil rights.  But this right of privacy isn't the right of
people to close their doors and pull down their window shades -- perhaps
because they want to engage in some sort of illicit or illegal activity.
It's the right of people to control what details about their lives stay
inside their own houses and what leaks to the outside...
    Today, more than ever before, we are witnessing the daily erosion of
personal privacy and freedom.  We're victims of a war on privacy that's being
waged by government eavesdroppers, business marketers, and nosy neighbors...
We know our privacy is under attack.  The problem is that we don't know how
to fight back.

    As we approach a new century and a changing international economic
climate, we think that scientific and technological education should be our
highest priority, and yet these fields, at least the way they are practiced
today, only tangentially affect the heart and soul, where morality and
values are rooted, while music goes right to the heart.
    Studying music, one learns about talent, thought, work, expression,
beauty, technique, collaboration, aesthetic judgment, inspiration, taste,
and a host of other elements that shape life in all its aspects.  As we
learn to control our fingers, lips, and breath in making music, subliminally
music is shaping us, making us people of sensitivity and judgment.

    Lawyers have, as Jonathan Swift observed, "a peculiar cant and
jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand".  They take care
to ensure that all legal business, including the drafting of legislation, is
conducted in this language "so that it will take thirty years to decide
whether the field left me by my ancestors for six generations belongs to me
or to a stranger three hundred miles off".  This language, condemned by
Jeremy Bentham as "literary garbage", "lawyers' cant", and "flash language",
serves various purposes, none of them in the public interest.  It unites
lawyers, distinguishing them from laymen.  It makes the law mysterious and
incomprehensible to those laymen, thus ensuring a steady supply of work for
lawyers who are needed to interpret the language they have invented.  The
language of the law fosters the illusion that legal problems are remediable
only by the application of the medicine of the specialist.  Only a lawyer,
can resolve the complexities of the problem: "Better see a lawyer; don't
trust Whatsisname" (as the memorable Law Society advertisement warned
consumers).  Legal language also enshrouds the law, hiding it from the
public it exists to serve.  The idiom of the lawyer leads to public ignorance
of the content of the law (which paradoxically refuses to recognize that
ignorance of the law should be a defence), to uninformed criticism and to
unmerited praise.  It provokes the indifference of too many laymen towards
the law and the contempt of so many litigants for a legal system they do not
understand.

    Men of Athens, fellow citizens, this is not a trial of Socrates, but
of ideas, and of Athens.  You are not prosecuting me for any unlawful or
impious act against our city or its altars.  No evidence of any such sort
has been brought against me.  You are not prosecuting me for anything I did,
but for what I have said and taught.  You are threatening me with death
because you do not like my views and my teaching.  This is a prosecution of
ideas and that is something new in our city's history.  In this sense,
Athens is in the dock, not Socrates.  Each of you, as my judges, is a
defendant.
    Let me be frank.  I do not believe in your so-called freedom of
speech, but you do.  I believe the opinions of ordinary men are only beliefs
without substance, pale shadows of reality, not to be taken seriously, and
only likely to lead a city astray.  I think it absurd to encourage the free
utterance of unfounded or irrational opinions, or to base civic policy on a
count of heads, like cabbages.  Hence I do not believe in democracy.  But
you do.  This is your test, not mine.  How can you boast of your free speech
if you suppress mine?
    The test of truly free speech is not whether what is said or taught
conforms to any rule or ruler, few or many.  Even under the worst dictator,
it is not forbidden to agree with him.  It is the freedom to disagree that
is freedom of speech.  This has been the Athenian rule until now, the pride
of our city, the glory on which your orators dwell.  Will you turn your back
on it now?  Ideas are not as fragile as men.  They cannot be made to drink
hemlock.  My ideas--and my example--will survive me.  But the good name of
Athens will wear a stain forever, if you violate its traditions by
convicting me.  The shame will be yours, not mine.

    Many of my friends are under the impression that I write these humorous
nothings in idle moments, when the wearied brain is unable to perform the
serious labors of the economist.  My own experience is exactly the other way.
The writing of solid, instructive stuff, fortified by facts and figures, is
easy enough.  There is no trouble in writing a scientific treatise on the
folklore of Central China, or a statistical inquiry into the declining
population of Prince Edward Island.  But to write something out of one's own
mind, worth reading for its own sake, is an arduous contrivance only to be
achieved in fortunate moments, few and far between.  Personally, I would sooner
have written Alice in Wonderland than the whole Encyclopedia Britannica.

I have been more concerned with the obscure than with the famous.
They are more often themselves.  They have had no need to create a
figure to protect themselves from the world or to impress it.  Their
idiosyncrasies have had more chance to develop in the limited circle
of their activity, and since they have never been in the public eye
it has never occurred to them that they have anything to conceal.
They display their oddities because it has never struck them that
they are odd.  And after all it is with the common run of men that
we writers have to deal; kings, dictators, commercial magnates are
from our point of view very unsatisfactory.  To write about them is
a venture that has often tempted writers, but the failure that has
attended their efforts shows that such beings are too exceptional to
form a proper ground for a work of art.  They cannot be made real.
The ordinary is the writer's richer field.  Its unexpectedness, its
singularity, its infinite variety afford unending material.  The
great man is too often all of a piece; it is the little man that is
a bundle of contradictory elements.  He is inexhaustible.  You never
come to the end of the surprises he has in store for you.  For my
part I would much sooner spend a month on a desert island with a
veterinary surgeon than with a prime minister.

The importance of people as creators and carriers of knowledge is forcing
organizations to realize that knowledge lies less in its databases than in
its people.  It's been said, for example, that if NASA wanted to go to the
moon again, it would have to start from scratch, having lost not the data,
but the human expertise that took it there last time.  Similarly, Tom
Davenport and Larry Prusake argue that when Ford wanted to build on the
success of the Taurus, the company found that the essence of that success
had been lost with the loss of the people that created it.  Their knowledge
was not stored in information technologies.  It left when they left.

...the act of producing a letter, even one which is never mailed,
necessitates a form of creative concentration which can improve our
lives.  Copies of our own letters are useful for our records and
memories.  If their recipients think them worth saving, they can have
value and effect far beyond that of the spoken word.  In friendship,
the letter is not only a message but a gift, a physical symbol of
esteem and affection.  In business or politics, the letter can not
only express the concerns of the moment but remain as a document of
such concerns, available for prolonged scrutiny by more than one
reader.  Moreover, while speakers and listeners in a debate are
vulnerable to emotion and subject to fallacy, the well-written letter
remains calm and crisp and is subject to nothing except superior reason.
It can convince the open-minded, goad the weak-hearted, give our
opponents an exact index of the level and intensity of our commitment,
and be quoted by those who agree with us.  But perhaps most importantly,
our letters are the proof and body of our concern for life in its detail
and our conviction that this concern should be shared with others.

    Once, as promised, bots start interacting with one another,
understanding bot behavior may become impossible.  Anyone who has
had to call a help line with a problem about the way an operating
system from one vendor and program from another are working together--
or failing to work--knows how hard it is to get anyone to take
responsibility for software interactions.  Support staff rapidly
renounce all knowledge of (and usually interest in) problems that
arise from interactions because there are just too many possibilities.
So it's easy to imagine sophisticated programmers, let alone ordinary
users, being unable to unravel how even a small group of bots reached
a particular state autonomously.  The challenge will be unfathomable
if, as one research group has it, we can "anticipate a scenario in
which billions of intelligent agents will roam the virtual world,
handling all levels of simple to complex negotiations and transactions.
    If human agents are confused with digital ones, if human action is
taken as mere information processing, and if the social complexities of
negotiation, delegation, and representation are reduced to "when x, do y,"
bots will end up with autonomy without accountability.  Their owners, by
contrast, may have accountability without control.

    Every other country scorns American materialism while striving in
every big and little way to match it.  Envy obviously has something to do
with it, but there is a true basis for this debate, and it is whether
America is in its ascendance or its decline.
    I myself think I recognize here several of the symptoms that Edward
Gibbons maintained were signs of the decline of Rome, and which arose not
from external enemies but from inside the country itself.  A mounting love
of show and luxury.  A widening gap between the very rich and the very poor.
An obsession with sex.  Freakishness in the arts masquerading as
originality, and enthusiasm pretending to creativeness...
    There is, too, the general desire to live off the state, whether it
is a junkie on welfare or an airline subsidized by the government: in a
word, the notion that Washington -- Big Daddy -- will provide.  And, most
disturbing of all, a developing moral numbness to vulgarity, violence, and
the assault on the simplest human decencies.
    Yet the original institutions of this country still have great
vitality: the Republic can be kept, but only if we care to keep it.  Much of
the turmoil in America springs from the energy of people who are trying to
apply those institutions to forgotten minorities who have awakened after a
long sleep.
    As I see it, in this country -- a land of the most persistent
idealism and the blandest cynicism -- the race is on between its decadence
and its vitality.  There are the woes, which we share with the world, that
you can see from your window: overpopulation; the pollution of the
atmosphere, the cities and the rivers; the destruction of nature.  I find it
impossible to believe that a nation that produced such dogged and ingenious
humans as Jefferson and Eli Whitney, John Deere and Ford, Kettering and
Oppenheimer and Edison and Franklin, is going to sit back and let the worst
happen.  There is now a possibility, at least, that nuclear energy can help
us to cure incurable diseases, to preserve our food indefinitely, and
through breeder reactors, which renew more power in the act of spending it,
can actually clean the cities and, let us pray, the oceans.  And that would
take us over a historical watershed that none of us has ever conceived.

    I grew up in the last days of the British Empire.  My childhood fell
in that era when the words 'imperialism' and 'the West' had not yet acquired
the connotations they have today -- they had not yet become, that is, mere
synonyms for 'racism,' 'oppression,' and 'exploitation'.
    Or, at any rate, they had not yet become so among the intellectual,
professional, and governing classes of Egypt.  In Cairo it was entirely
ordinary, among those classes, to grow up speaking English or French or
both, and quite ordinary to attend an English or French school.  It was taken
for granted among the people who raised us that there was unquestionably
much to admire in and learn from the civilization of Europe and the great
strides that Europe had made in human advancement.  No matter that the
European powers were politically oppressive and indeed blatantly unjust; nor
did it seem to matter that the very generation which raised us were
themselves locked in struggle with the British for Egypt's political
independence.  There seemed to be no contradiction for them between pursuing
independence from the European powers and deeply admiring European
institutions, particularly democracy, and Europe's tremendous scientific
breakthroughs.

    The day came when Grandmother couldn't keep all her stuff in the two
tiny rooms to which she was finally reduced.  So she packed everything
she didn't need into enormous shopping bags and took off for the bank
in the center of the city where she kept her account, by then down to
a few pennies.  Her husband had started the bank and had been its
chairman until he died, and she was still treated with the consideration
due his widow.  But when she appeared with her shopping bags and asked
to have the contents put on her account, the manager balked.  "We can't
put things on an account," he said, "only money."
    "That's mean and ungrateful of you," said Grandmother, "you only do
this to me because I am a stupid old woman."
     And she promptly closed her account and drew out the balance.  Then
she went down the street to the nearest branch of the same bank, reopened
her account there, and never said a word about her shopping bags.
     "Grandmother," we'd say, "if you thought the bank was unfriendly why
did you reopen your account at another branch?"
    "It's a good bank," she said; "after all, my late husband founded it."
    "Then why not demand that the manager at the new branch take your
stuff?"
    "I never banked there before.  He didn't owe me anything."

The pressures for upscale consumption, and the work schedules
that go along with it, created millions of exhausted, stressed-
out people who started wondering if the cycle of work and spend
was really worth it.  And some concluded that it wasn't.  So
they started downshifting, reducing their hours of work and, in
the process, earning and spending less money.  Downshifters are
opting out of excessive consumerism, choosing to have more
leisure and balance in their schedules, a slower pace of life,
more time with their kids, more meaningful work, and daily lives
that line up squarely with their deepest values.  These are not
just fast-track yuppies leaving $200,000 jobs in Manhattan to
settle in Montana, although there are plenty of those.
Downshifters can be found at all income levels, from the
comfortable suburbanites whose homes are paid for, to those who
are counting every penny, resigned to the fact that they'll never
own a home.  Their jobs were leaving them drained, depressed, or
wondering what life is all about.  Now they may not have as much
money, but they are spending every day answering that all-
important question.

The need to reach better mutual understanding through dialogue

business.  The traditional top-down style of leadership in a
fortress-type company semi-isolated from others is increasingly
out of vogue.  It is being replaced by what I have come to

leaders is developing webs of relationships with others rather
than handing down visions, strategies, and plans as if they

    Fortunately, many teachers intuitively know that the best way to
achieve their goals is to enlist students' interest on their side.
They do this by being sensitive to students' goals and desires, and
they are thus able to articulate the pedagogical goals as meaningful
challenges.  They empower students to take control of their learning;
they provide clear feedback to the students' efforts without
threatening their egos and without making them self-conscious.  They
help students concentrate and get immersed in the symbolic world of
the subject matter.  As a result, good teachers still turn out
children who enjoy learning, and who will continue to face the world
with curiosity and interest.
    It is to be hoped that with time the realization that children
are not miniature computing machines will take root in educational
circles, and more attention will be paid to motivational issues.
Unless this comes to pass, the current problems we are having with
education are not likely to go away.

Paradoxes have played a dramatic role in intellectual history,
often foreshadowing revolutionary developments in science,
mathematics, and logic.  Whenever, in any discipline, we discover
a problem that cannot be solved within the conceptual framework
that supposedly should apply, we experience shock.  The shock may
compel us to discard the old framework and adopt a new one.  It
is to this process of intellectual molting that we owe the birth
of many of the major ideas in mathematics and science.  Zeno's
paradox of Achilles and the tortoise gave birth to the idea of
convergent infinite series.  'Antinomies' (internal contradictions
in mathematical logic) eventually blossomed into Godel's theorem.
The paradoxical result of the Michelson-Morley experiment on the
speed of light set the stage for the theory of relativity.  The
discovery of wave-particle duality of light forced a reexamination
of deterministic causality, the very foundation of scientific
philosophy, and led to quantum mechanics.

    Why is autobiography the most popular form of nonfiction
for modern readers?  Why are so many people moved to write their
life stories today?  And what is it about the genre that makes
it appeal to readers not just in the Western world, but also in
non-Western cultures, like those of Japan and India or the many
cultures of Africa?...
    What makes the reading of autobiography so appealing is the
chance it offers to see how this man or that woman whose public
self interests us has negotiated the problem of self-awareness
and has broken the internalized code a culture supplies about
how life should be experienced.  Most of us, unless faced with
emotional illness, don't give our inner life scripts a fraction
of the attention we give to the plots of movies or TV specials
about some person of prominence.  Yet the need to examine our
inherited scripts is just beneath the surface of consciousness,
so that while we think we are reading a gripping story, what
really grips us is the inner reflection on our own lives the
autobiographer sets in motion.

    Modern housekeeping, despite its bad press, is among the most
thoroughly pleasant, significant, and least alienated forms of work
that many of us will encounter even if we are blessed with work
outside the home that we like.  Once, it was so physically onerous
and arduous that it not infrequently contributed to a woman's total
physical breakdown.  Today, laundry, cleaning, and other household
chores are by and large physically light or moderate work that doctors
often recommend to people for their health, as evidence shows that
housework is good for weight control and healthy hearts.
    Seen from the outside, housework can look like a Sisyphean task
that gives you no sense of reward or completion.  Yet housekeeping
actually offers more opportunities for savoring achievement than
almost any other work I can think of.  Each of its regular routines
brings satisfaction when it is completed.  These routines echo the
rhythm of life, and the housekeeping rhythm is the rhythm of the body.
You get satisfaction not only from the sense of order, cleanliness,
freshness, peace and plenty restored, but from the knowledge that you
yourself and those you care about are going to enjoy these benefits.

    War, it seems to me, after a lifetime of reading about the subject,
mingling with men of war, visiting the sites of war and observing its
effects, may well be ceasing to commend itself to human beings as a
desirable or productive, let alone rational, means of reconciling their
discontents.  This is not mere idealism.  Mankind does have the capacity,
over time, to correlate the costs and benefits of large and universal
undertakings.
    Throughout much of the time for which we have a record of human
behaviour, mankind can clearly be seen to have judged that war's benefits
outweighed its costs, or appeared to do so when a putative balance was
struck.  Now the computation works in the opposite direction.  Costs
clearly exceed benefits.  Some of these costs are material.  The
superinflationary expense of weapon procurement distorts the budgets even
of the richest states, while poor states deny themselves the chance of
economic emancipation when they seek to make themselves militarily
formidable.
    The human costs of actually going to war are even higher.  Rich
states, as between themselves, recognize that they are not to be borne.
Poor states which fall into war with rich states are overwhelmed and
humiliated.  Poor states which fight each other, or are drawn into civil
war, destroy their own well being, and even the structures which make
recovery from the experience of war possible.  War truly has become a
scourge, as was disease throughout most of human history.  The scourge
of disease has, almost within living memory, been very largely defeated
and, though it is true that disease had no friends as war has had friends,
war now demands a friendship which can only be paid in false coin.
    A world political economy which makes no room for war demands, it
must be recognized, a new culture of human relations.  As most cultures of
which we have knowledge were transfused by the warrior spirit, such a
cultural transformation demands a break with the past for which there are
no precedents.  There is no precedent, however, for the menace with which
future war now confronts the world.

    Despite the abundant evidence that compassion is a basic
human trait, the view has long prevailed that human beings are
either heartless or brutal toward most of their fellows.  Every
compendium of familiar quotations has an abundance of statements
like "The greatest enemy to man is man" (Robert Burton) but
almost none like "Precious is man to man" (Thomas Carlyle).
Altruism research attests that kindness is as integral to human
nature as cruelty, yet in the news and in the historical record
cruel acts vastly outnumber kind ones.
    Why are we keenly aware of the despicable in us but largely
insensible of the admirable?  Not, I suggest, because the
despicable is common and the admirable rare but the very reverse.
Prosocial behavior of all sorts, including altruism, is so normal
and expected that we scarcely notice it but are struck by its
absence or opposite.  We see nothing unusual in a passerby's
helping a fallen elderly person to his feet but are surprised and
disturbed if the passerby ignores him.  We expect people to be
kind and helpful to a stranger in distress; we are startled and
troubled when they look away and hurry past.  Cruelty is
attention-getting, kindness unremarkable, and so we agree with
Seneca that "man delights to ruin man" and with William James that
"of all the beasts of prey... [man is] the only one that preys
systematically on its own species".

the vox has popped--the voice has cracked from too many command performances.
Polls are contributing to a strange new volatility in public opinion...
    The dramatic rises and drops are fueled in part by mass media and their
famous steady drumbeat of what's not working, from an increase in reported
child abuse to a fall in savings.  When this tendency is not prompted by
ideology it is legitimate: good news isn't news.  But the volatility is also
driven by the polls themselves.  People think they have to have an answer
when they are questioned by pollsters, and they think the answer has to be
"intelligent" and "not naive".  This has the effect of hardening opinions
that haven't even been formed yet.  Poll questions do not invite subtlety or
response.  This dispels ambiguity, when a lot of thoughts and opinions are
ambiguous.
    And we are polled too often.  We are constantly having our temperature
taken, like a hypochondriac who is looking for the reassurance no man can
have, i.e., that he will not die...  Nations that use polls as daily
temperature readings inevitably give inauthentic readings, and wind up not
reassured but demoralized.

    Most of us find ourselves at one time or another in a toy shop,
looking for a gift for a child.  Those of us who have not been in such
stores since our youth can easily be bewildered, especially if we were
born before the 1960s.  Our favorite toys or games--fire engines,
Tinkertoys, or baby dolls--have disappeared or are hidden in row after
row of heroic fighters, fashion dolls, and exotic stuffed animals.  The
more practical of us enter the store with a list of items desired by
the child--this season's action figure, the newest Barbie, or the
latest video game.  Veteran toy shoppers may enjoy the inevitable
transformations as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles give way to Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers and Locket Surprise Barbie to Tropic Splash
Barbie.  But equally we may be appalled to think about the dozens of
Ninja Turtles that an older boy just had to have a year earlier but
that were then shunned by a younger brother who just had to have Power
Rangers.  Why don't kids pass down their toys as we remember giving our
building blocks and dollhouses to our younger brothers and sisters?  It
is easy to wonder whether each year's must-have toys are really for
children's play or whether their ever-changing forms represent other
forces at work.
    There have been disturbing changes in the making of playthings in
the last few decades.  Since the late 1960s many old toy companies,
venerated for manufacturing toys passed from one generation to the
next, have disappeared...
    A tradition of manufacturing boys' construction and science sets
promised parents that their children would be preparing to join the
adult world of engineering, industry, and science...  The old kitchen
play sets, dollhouses, and baby dolls that were to teach girls the arts
of housekeeping and childcare are also less in evidence today.  Toys
that seem to prepare children for adult life have become harder to
find.
    The ever-expanding toy industry reflects a general American
commitment to unrestrained markets and to constant change, a commitment
at least a century old.  Americans have long admired the new and have
enriched those who produce it.  For decades American parents have
enjoyed sharing the world of consumption with their offspring.  At
first they did so knowing that they ultimately mediated between toys
and their children.  When the floodgates were opened and torrents of
toys were presented directly to kids, parents found themselves merely
providers of funds to buy toys.

    Expertise, it may be argued, sacrifices the insight of common sense
to intensity of experience.  It breeds an inability to accept new views from
the very depth of its preoccupation with its won conclusions.  It too often
fails to see round its subject.  It sees its results out of perspective by
making them the centre of relevance to which all other results must be
related.  Too often, also, it lacks humility; and this breeds in its
possessors a failure in proportion which makes them fail to see the obvious
which is before their very noses.  It has, also, a certain caste-spirit about
it, so that experts tend to neglect all evidence which does not come from
those who belong to their own ranks.
    Above all, perhaps, and this most urgently when human problems are
concerned, the expert fails to see that every judgment he makes not purely
factual in nature brings with it a scheme of values which has no special
validity about it.  He tends to confuse the importance of his facts with the
importance of what he proposes to do about them.

    Sleep is simply not dispensable, regardless of the attempts in
today's society to treat it as if it were simply unproductive 'downtime'.
The desire to get more sleep is not a sign of laziness, nor does it
represent a lack of ambition.  The need for sleep is real...
    When we try to sleep less than the 8-hour minimum, things start to
deteriorate.  First of all, the effects of less than 8 hours of sleep a
night seem to accumulate as a sleep debt.  If you lose 2 hours today and 2
hours tomorrow, on the third day your efficiency is as low as if you had
lost 4 hours in one night.  This is the way our sleep debt builds up.
Eventually, if the sleep debt becomes large enough, we become slow, clumsy,
stupid, and, possibly, dead.  This is not an exaggeration.  Remember, the
national death rate by accidents jumps 6 percent as a result of simply
losing 1 hour of sleep as we shift to daylight savings time in the spring...
    Perhaps someday society will act to do something about sleepiness.
It may even come to pass that someday the person who drives or goes to work
while sleepy will be viewed as being as reprehensible, dangerous, or even
criminally negligent as the person who drives or goes to work while drunk.
If so, perhaps the rest of us can all sleep a little bit more soundly.

    If someone asks you, "Where do you live?" you are likely to answer
with the name of a neighborhood, or a nearby geographic landmark.  But if you
give the question a sharper focus and ask yourself "And do I really live
there?" then the answer becomes more vexing.  Most of us can't claim to
really live in the neighborhoods where we sleep.  Few of us have the time to
take part in the life of the community, and in many cases there is no
community life to take part in.  To varying degrees many of us can say of
our neighborhoods what Gertrude Stein said of Oakland: "There is no _there_
there."

Today, the notion of a star-spangled melting pot seems quaint,
of another age.  Increasingly, America is a fractured landscape,
its people partitioned into dozens of cultural enclaves, its
ideals reflected through differing prisms of experience.  And
this fracturing is likely to continue as the self-concept of
America shifts from a majority white-minority black nation to
a pluralistic society of many ethnic and racial groups.  At the
close of what's been called the American Century, during which
the nation emerged as the dominant world power in commerce and
politics, old myths are dying hard and new ones are just being
forged.  In this clustered world, the national identity is
changing, and most of us don't even know it.  Forget the melting
pot.  America today would be better characterized as a salad bar.

Daydreaming does not enjoy tremendous prestige in our culture,
which tends to regard it as unproductive thought.  Writers
perhaps appreciate its importance better than most, since a
fair amount of what they call work consists of little more
than daydreaming edited.  Yet anyone who reads for pleasure
should prize it too, for what is reading a good book but a
daydream at second hand?  Unlike any other form of thought,
daydreaming is its own reward.  For regardless of the result
(if any), the very process of daydreaming is pleasurable.
And, I would guess, is probably a psychological necessity.
For isn't it in our daydreams that we acquire some sense of
what we are about?  Where we try on futures and practice our
voices before committing ourselves to words or deeds?
Daydreaming is where we go to cultivate the self, or, more
likely, selves, out of the view and earshot of other people.
Without its daydreams, the self is apt to shrink down to the
size and shape of the estimation of others.

It is time we start searching for the fountain of age, time that
we stop denying our growing older and look at the actuality of our
own experience, and that of other women and men who have gone
beyond denial to a new place in their sixties, seventies, eighties.
It is time to look at age on its own terms, and put names on its
values and strengths as they are actually experienced, breaking
through the definition of age solely as deterioration or decline
from youth.  Only then will we see that the problem is not age
itself, to be denied or warded off as long as possible, that the
problem is not those increasing numbers of people living beyond
sixty-five, to be segregated from the useful, valuable, pleasurable
activities of society so that the rest of us can keep our illusion
of staying forever young.  Nor is the basic political problem the
burden on society of those forced into deterioration, second
childhood, even senility.  The problem is not how we can stay young
forever, personally--or avoid facing society's problems politically
by shifting them onto age.  The problem is, first of all, how to
break through the cocoon of our illusory youth and risk a new stage
in life, where there are not prescribed role models to follow, no
guidepost, no rigid rules or visible rewards, to step out into the
true existential unknown of these new years of life now open to us,
and to find our own terms for living it.

    Personal computers are less able to sense human presence
than are modern toilets or outdoor floodlights that have simple
motion sensors.  Your inexpensive auto-focus camera has more
intelligence about what is in front of it than any terminal or
computer system.
    When you lift your hands from your computer keyboard, it
does not know whether the pause is reflective, a nature break,
or an interruption for lunch.  It cannot tell the difference
between talking to you alone or in front of six other people.
It does not know if you are in your night-or party clothes or
no clothes at all.  For all it knows, you could have your back
to it while it was showing you something important, or you
could be out of earshot altogether while it was speaking to you.
    We think today solely from the perspective of what would
make it easier for a person to use a computer.  It may be time
to ask what will make it easier for computers to deal with
humans.  For example, how can you possibly hold a conversation
with people if you don't even know they are there?  You can't
see them, and you don't know how many there are.  Are they
smiling?  Are they even paying attention?  We talk longingly
about human-computer interactions and conversational systems,
and yet we are fully prepared to leave one participant in this
dialogue totally in the dark.  It is time to make computers see

    The scientific community speaks about its work in a cool
and disinterested manner.  To present an exciting profile
would be unprofessional.  Any excess of emotion would suggest
a lack of neutrality and therefore a tendency to read what
they want in the facts rather than reporting what they see.
Scientific objectivity must therefore appear to be boring.
    Scientists are well aware that their work is neither
boring nor objective.  If it were, very few discoveries would
be made.
    Social science, being falsely empirical, is triply
obsessed by the obligation to present itself as the objective
interpretation of observed reality.  Since the more or less
hard edges of scientific inquiry are not involved, social
scientists are free to be more categorical about truth,
reality and what they call facts.  They therefore seek to be
more boring than scientists.

    In the game known as Broken Telephone (or Chinese Whispers) a child
whispers a phrase into the ear of a second child, who whispers it into
the ear of a third child, and so one.  Distortions accumulate, and when
the last child announces the phrase, it is comically different from the
original.  The game works because each child does not merely degrade the
phrase, which would culminate in a mumble, but reanalyzes it, making a
best guess about the words the preceding child had in mind.
    All languages change through the centuries.  We do not speak like

changes take place, people feel the ground eroding under their feet and
in every era have predicted the imminent demise of the language.  Yet
the twelve hundred years of changes since Beowulf have not left us
grunting like Tarzan, and that is because language change is a game of
Broken Telephone.
    A generation of speakers uses their lexicon and grammar to produce
sentences.  The younger generation listens to the sentences and tries to
infer the lexicon and grammar, the remarkable feat we call language
acquisition.  The transmission of a lexicon and grammar in language
acquisition is fairly high in fidelity -- you probably can communicate
well with your parents and your children -- but it is never perfect.
Words rise and fall in popularity, as the needs of daily life change, and
also as the hip try to sound different from the dweebs and graybeards.
Speakers swallow or warp some sounds to save effort, and enunciate or
shift others to make themselves understood.  Immigrants or conquerors
with regional or foreign accents may swamp the locals and change the pool
of speech available to children.
    Children, for their part, do not mimic sentences like parrots but try
to make sense of them in terms of underlying words and rules.  They may
hear a mumbled consonant as no consonant at all, or a drawn-out or
mispronounced vowel as a different vowel.  They may fail to discern the
rationale for a rule and simply memorize its outputs as a list.  Or they
may latch on to some habitual way of ordering words and hypothesize a new
rule to make sense of it.  The language of their generation will have
changed, though it need not have deteriorated.  Then the process is
repeated with their children.  Each change may be small, but as changes
accumulate over centuries they reshape the language just as erosion and
sedimentation imperceptibly sculpt the earth.

    Most human beings have to spend their lives in utter vulnerability.
All are murderable and torturable, and survive only through the restraint
shown by more powerful neighbors.  All are born unequal, in terms of
capacity or strength.  All are born to the inherent frailty of the human
condition, naked and helpless, vulnerable all through life to the will of
others, limited by ignorance, limited by physical weakness, limited by
fear, limited by the phobias that fear engenders.
    For nearly three thousand years now, the political and social genius
of what we can permissibly call 'Western man' has struggled with these
brute facts of our unsatisfactory existence.  Ever since the Hebrews
discovered personal moral responsibility and the Greeks discovered the
autonomy of the citizen, the effort has been made--with setbacks and
defeats, with dark ages and interregnums and any number of irrelevant
adventures on the side-to create a social order in which weak, fallible,
obstinate, silly, magnificent man can maintain his dignity and exercise his

    The First Daily Sin is imitation.  How can the network evening
news programs be so similar?  We're in a commercial, highly competitive
struggle for viewers, and yet our solution for standing out in the
marketplace is--do just what the competition is doing.  CBS research shows
that half the viewers of any given evening news broadcast--on CBS, NBC, or
ABC--only watch that particular program one night a week.  The implication
is obvious: To these viewers, it doesn't make much of a difference which
one they watch--or whether they watch at all.
    The Second Daily Sin is predictability.  How often are you surprised
by something you see on the news?
    The Third Daily Sin is artificiality.  If you stop and really
listen to how a typical television reporter tells a story, you'll hear how
artificial it sounds.  Even words--'pontiff' comes quickly to mind--that you
never hear in real life.  Nobody talks that way--except for us.
    The Fourth Daily Sin is laziness.  The people I work with put in
long hours and are very devoted to their jobs.  They're certainly not lazy
in the conventional sense.  But I think we've all become lazy in our
thinking, in our reluctance to dig out original stories and come up with
new ways to tell them.
    The Fifth Daily Sin is oversimplification.  Our audience is smarter
and more thoughtful than a lot of us think.  The people out there in America
know that life is not as simple as what they see on the news: a world of
heroes and villains, winners and losers, exploiters and victims.  Yet that's
what we show them, night after night.
    The Sixth Daily Sin is hype.  Can you remember the last 'story
you'll never forget?'  How about the one before that?  I can't.  Over the
years we've exaggerated so much that we've eroded our own ability to convey
what's truly significant.
    The Seventh Daily Sin is cynicism.  I think we're cynical about the
audience and cynical about our ability to make a difference in peoples'
lives.  Journalists today are held in low esteem, but that doesn't have to
be.  Our viewers and listeners are also hungry for honest information, for
help in coping with a bewildering world.  We have an enormous opportunity to
win our good name back--and insure our own survival in the bargain.

Dr. Laura eats the Bible, live
------------------------------
    Laura Schlessinger is a radio personality who dispenses advice to
people who call in to her radio show.  Paramount Television Group is
currently producing a "Dr. Laura" television show.  She has become a
convert to Judaism, and now she is Ba'al T'shuvah.
    Recently, she made some statements about homosexuals, based on
biblical edicts.  The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura that
was posted on the internet.

--

Dear Dr. Laura,
    Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law.
I have learned a great deal from your show, and I try to share that
knowledge with as many people as I can.
    When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example,
I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an
abomination.  End of debate.
    Now I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the
specific laws and how to best follow them.
    a) When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates
a pleasing odour for the Lord (Lev.1:9).  The problem is my neighbours.
They claim the odour is not pleasing to them.  Should I smite them?
    b) I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in
Exodus 21:7.  In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair
price for her?
    c) I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in
her period of menstrual uncleanliness (Lev.15:19-24).  The problem is, how
do I tell?  I have tried asking, but most women take offence.
    d) Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and
female, provided they are purchased from neighbouring nations.  A friend
of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians.  Can
you clarify?  Why can't I own Canadians?
    e) I have a neighbour who insists on working on the Sabbath.  Exodus
35:2 clearly states he should be put to death.  Am I morally obligated
to kill him myself?
    f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an
Abomination (Lev. 11:10), it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.
I don't agree.  Can you settle this?
    g) Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I
have a defect in my sight.  I have to admit that I wear reading glasses.
Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?
    h) Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair
around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.
19:27.  How should they die?
    i) I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes
me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?
    j) My uncle has a farm.  He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two
different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments
made of two different kinds of thread (cotton / polyester blend).  He
also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot.  Is it really necessary that we
go to the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them?
(Lev. 24:10-16)  Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family
affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)
    I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident
you can help.  Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is
eternal and unchanging.
Your devoted disciple and adoring fan,
Aaron

    It would be too pat, perhaps, to say that modern people, men and
women, expect the unexpected.  But they certainly expect, or are inured
to, constant change...  Unquestionably, people sense constant movement,
change, alteration, and 'progress'.  Even clothes are supposed to change
from year to year: there is this year's fashion, and last year's fashion,
and the fashions of the year before.
    Then there is the idea of 'news,' that is, of something novel
happening every day, something worth reporting.  Millions of people wake up
in the morning and watch the news on television; they may also listen to
radio news throughout the day and later catch the evening television news.
It would be unthinkable to read in the newspapers or to hear on television
that 'nothing much happened today.'  There is always news, always something
going on, always change.  Some days bring major headlines; other days are
quieter.  But there is never no news: the message we get every day is that
things are never exactly the same.

    Until now, in the Western world, leisure was the exclusive
possession of a privileged class, which took upon itself the task of
playing on behalf of the whole overworked society.  For all the injustices
which this entailed, it can be argued that this inequality in the
distribution of leisure gave the minority that enjoyed it a certain
responsibility for the quality of its amusements.
    Today our machines have turned leisure into an almost universal
and obligatory state, one which many of us are finding enervating and even
painful.  To live free of the burden of grinding toil is the oldest of
man's dreams.  Yet no sooner has he rid himself of the accursed necessity
of earning his living by the sweat of his brow, then he is confronted by a
huge and alarming vacuum which -- if he is not to go mad -- must be quickly
and entirely filled.  With this new and abundant leisure come certain
inescapable demands not to squander unimaginatively the resources that
industrialization has opened for us.  Many of us-consciously seldom, but
unconsciously often-find this challenge so disturbing that we flee back to
artificially strenuous work or even to war in order to escape the
perplexities of choice presented to abundant leisure.

    Most of America's millionaires are first-generation rich.  How is
it possible for people from modest backgrounds to become millionaires in
one generation?  Why is it that so many people with similar socioeconomic
backgrounds never accumulate even modest amounts of wealth?
    Most people who become millionaires have confidence in their own
abilities.  They do not spend time worrying about whether or not their
parents were wealthy.  They do not believe that one must be born wealthy.
Conversely, people of modest backgrounds who believe that only the wealthy
produce millionaires are predetermined to remain non-affluent.  Have you
always thought that most millionaires are born with silver spoons in their
mouths?  If so, consider the following facts that our research uncovered
about American millionaires:
    * Only 19 percent receive any income or wealth of any kind from a
      trust fund or an estate.
    * Fewer than 20 percent inherited 10 percent or more of their wealth.
    * More than half never received as much as $1 in inheritance.
    * Fewer than 25 percent ever received "an act of kindness" of $10,000
      or more from their parents, grandparents, or other relatives.
    * Ninety-one percent never received, as a gift, as much as $1 of the
      ownership of a family business.
    * Nearly half never received any college tuition from their parents
      or other relatives.
    * Fewer than 10 percent believe they will ever receive an inheritance
      in the future.
    America continues to hold great prospects for those who wish to
accumulate wealth in one generation.  In fact, America has always been a
land of opportunity for those who believe in the fluid nature of our
nation's social system and economy.

    In Rome, Athens, and Sparta, honor alone was the reward for the
greatest of services.  A wreath of oak-leaves or laurel, a statue or public
congratulations was an immense reward for winning a battle or capturing a town.
    In these cities, a man who had accomplished some great feat was
sufficiently rewarded by the accomplishment itself.  He could not meet any
of his fellow-citizens without feeling the pleasure of having done
something for them; he could calculate the extent of his services by the
number of his countrymen.  Everybody is capable of doing good to one man,
but it is god-like to contribute to the happiness of an entire society."

    As I considered the premise put forth in the meeting room: that
the shortest road to wisdom and peace with the world is the one that turns
inward, away from direct sensory contact with other creatures.  I will not
assert that meditation, psychotherapy, and philosophical introspection are
unproductive, but I simply can't accept that inward is the only or best way
for everyone to turn.  The more disciplined practitioners of contemplative
traditions can turn inward and still get beyond the self, but many others
simply become swamped by self-indulgence.  There are far too many people
living in our society who forget daily that other creatures--five kingdoms'
worth of them--are cohabiting the planet with us.
    Over half a century ago, Robinson Jeffers suggested that it may be
just as valid to turn outward: "The whole human race spends too much
emotion on itself.  The happiest and freest man is the scientist
investigating nature or the artist admiring it, the person who is
interested in things that are not human.  Or if he is interested in human
beings, let him regard them objectively as a small part of the great music."

    For the benefit of the two or three other people in this society
who don't know what 'Cats' is about, here's the answer: It's about a bunch
of cats.  The cats jump around in a postnuclear junkyard for some two and a
half hours, bumping and grinding to that curiously Mesozoic pop music for
which Andrew Lloyd Webber is famous--the kind of full-tilt truckin' that
sounds like the theme from 'The Mod Squad.'  There's an Elvis impersonator
cat, and a cat that looks like Cyndi Lauper, and a cat that looks like
Phyllis Diller.  All the other cast members look like Jon Bon Jovi with two
weeks of facial growth.
    Sure, 'Cats' is allegedly based upon the works of T. S. Eliot, but
from what I could tell, the show had about as much to do with the author of
'The Waste Land' as those old Steve Reeves movies had to do with Euripides.
'Cats' is what 'Grease' would look like if all the cast members dressed up
like KISS.  To give you an idea of how bad 'Cats' is, think of a musical
where you're actually glad to hear 'Memory' reprised a third time because
all the other songs are so awful.  Think of a musical where the songs are so
bad that 'Memory' starts to sound like 'Ol' Man River' by comparison.
That's how bad 'Cats' is.

    What is more interesting in this world than our fellow human
beings and other living creatures?  Why do we know so few of what must be
out there?  What kind of philistines are we?  Yet we can make a more
practical point than this.  We need to interact with other species whether
we want to or not.  They are our food and our environment: homes, scenery,
soil, even the oxygen in the air is provided by courtesy of plants and
photosynthesizing bacteria.  We need actively to exploit our fellow
creatures to survive.  This is not an option: we have to exploit them unless
we prefer to die.  Therefore purely for selfish reasons (as well as for
reasons that we may hope are less selfish) we also need to conserve them.
Besides, even if we learnt to do without our fellow creatures--perhaps
found some inexhaustible supply of food on some distant planet--they would
not necessarily ignore us.  We are flesh, too, for all our conceit, and many
are more than happy to feed upon us.  To contain, exploit, or conserve our
fellow creatures we need to keep tabs on them.

    Nature's technology occurs on the surface of the same planet as
that of human culture, so it endures the same physical and chemical
limitations and must use the same materials.  But nature copes and invents
in a way fundamentally different from what we do.  At the very least, the
rate at which she alters herself is glacial by our cultural standard.
    The very shapes of the two technologies differ dramatically.  Just
look around you.  Right angles are everywhere: the edges of this page, desk
corners, street corners, floor corners, shelves, doors, boxes, bricks, and
on and on.  Then look at field, park, or forest.  Where are the right angles?
Absent?  No, but rare, which raises questions.  Why so few right angles in
nature?  Why do civilizations find them so serviceable?
    Natural and human technologies differ extensively and pervasively.
We build dry and stiff structures; nature mostly makes hers wet and
flexible.  We build of metals; nature never does.  Our hinges mainly slide;
hers mostly bend.  We do wonders with wheels and rotary motion; nature makes
fully competent boats, aircraft, and terrestrial vehicles that lack them
entirely.  Our engines expand or spin; hers contract or slide.  We fabricate
large devices directly; nature's large things are cunning proliferations of
tiny components.

    Unlike the Industrial Revolution, the Biomimicry Revolution
introduces an era based not on what we can extract from nature, but on what
we can learn from her...  'doing it nature's way' has the potential to
change the way we grow food, make materials, harness energy, heal
ourselves, store information, and conduct business.
    In a biomimetic world, we would manufacture the way animals and
plants do, using sun and simple compounds to produce totally biodegradable
fibers, ceramics, plastics, and chemicals.  Our farms, modeled on prairies,
would be self-fertilizing and pest-resistant.  To find new drugs or crops,
we would consult animals and insects that have used plants for millions of
years to keep themselves healthy and nourished.  Even computing would take
its cue from nature, with software that "evolves" solutions, and hardware
that uses the lock-and-key paradigm to compute by touch.
    In each case, nature would provide the models: solar cells copied
from leaves, steely fibers woven spider-style, shatterproof ceramics drawn
from mother-of-pearl, cancer cures compliments of chimpanzees, perennial
grains inspired by tallgrass, computers that signal like cells, and a
closed-loop economy that takes its lessons from redwoods, coral reefs, and
oak-hickory forests.
    The biomimics are discovering what works in the natural world, and
more important, what lasts.  After 3.8 billion years of research and
development, failures are fossils, and what surrounds us is the secret to
survival.  The more our world looks and functions like this natural world,
the more likely we are to be accepted on this home that is ours, but not
ours alone.

    When issues of public policy are discussed in the outward form
of an argument, often the conclusions reached are predetermined by
the assumptions and definitions inherent in a particular vision of
social processes.  Different visions, of course, have different
assumptions, so it is not uncommon for people who follow different
visions to find themselves in opposition to one another across a
vast spectrum of unrelated issues, in such disparate fields as law,
foreign policy, the environment, racial policy, military defense,
education, and many others.  To a remarkable extent, however,
empirical evidence is neither sought beforehand nor consulted after
a policy has been instituted.  Facts may be marshaled for a position
already taken, but that is very different from systematically
testing opposing theories by evidence.  Momentous questions are
dealt with essentially as conflicts of vision.

Fine things books, but perhaps the moment has come to stop taking them

reading supplies the most cunning of all means of avoiding thought.  It
would be good once in awhile to try thinking without the stimulus of
books, to become not an out of-the-box -- never, please, that -- but at
least an out-of-the-book thinker.  Books may furnish a room, but there
surely are other things quite as suitable for furnishing a mind.  Time,

    For some years, we have been surprised and distressed by the
intellectual trends in certain precincts of American academia.
Vast sectors of the humanities and the social sciences seem to
have adopted a philosophy that we shall call, for want of a better
term, "postmodernism": an intellectual current characterized by
the more-or-less explicit rejection of the rationalist tradition
of the Enlightenment, by theoretical discourses disconnected from
any empirical test, and by a cognitive and cultural relativism
that regards science as nothing more than a 'narration,' a 'myth'
or a social construction among many others.
    To respond to this phenomenon, one of us (Sokal) decided to try
an unorthodox (and admittedly uncontrolled), experiment: submit to
a fashionable American cultural-studies journal, "Social Text," a
parody of the type of work that has proliferated in recent years,
to see whether they would publish it.  The article, entitled
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics
of Quantum Gravity", is chock-full of absurdities and blatant
non-sequiturs.  In addition, it asserts an extreme form of cognitive
relativism: after mocking the old-fashioned "dogma" that "there
exists an external world, whose properties are independent of any
individual human being and indeed of humanity as a whole", it
proclaims categorically that "physical `reality', no less than
social `reality', is at bottom a social and linguistic construct".
By a series of stunning leaps of logic, it arrives at the conclusion
that "the [Pi] of Euclid and the G of Newton, formerly thought to be
constant and universal, are now perceived in their ineluctable
historicity; and the putative observer becomes fatally de-centered,
disconnected from any epistemic link to a space-time point that can
no longer be defined by geometry alone".  The rest is in the same vein.
    And yet, the article was accepted and published.  Worse, it was
published in a special issue of 'Social Text' devoted to rebutting the
criticisms leveled against postmodernism and social constructivism by
several distinguished scientists.  For the editors of 'Social Text,'
it was hard to imagine a more radical way of shooting themselves in
the foot.

    We take pleasure in answering thus prominently the communication
below, expressing at the same time our great gratification that its
faithful author is numbered among the friends of The Sun:
    'I am 8 years old.  Some of my little friends say there is no Santa
Claus.  Papa says, "If you see it in The Sun, it's so." Please tell me
the truth, is there a Santa Claus?' -- Virginia O'Hanlon
    Virginia, your little friends are wrong.  They have been affected by
the skepticism of a sceptical age.  They do not believe except they see.
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little
minds.  All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are
little.  In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant, in
his intellect as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured
by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
    Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
    He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and
you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.
Alas!  how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus!  It would
be as dreary as if there were no Virginias.  There would be no childlike
faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence.  We
should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight.  The external light
with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.
    Not believe in Santa Claus!  You might as well not believe in fairies.
You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on
Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if you did not see Santa Claus
coming down, what would that prove?  Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no
sign that there is no Santa Claus.  The most real things in the world are
those that neither children nor men can see.  Did you ever see fairies
dancing on the lawn?  Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not
there.  Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and
unseeable in the world.
    You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside,
but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man,
nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived could
tear apart.  Only faith, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain
and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond.  Is it all real?
Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
    No Santa Claus?  Thank God he lives and lives forever.  A thousand
years from now, Virginia, nay 10 times 10,000 years from now, he will
continue to make glad the heart of childhood.
    Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!

     in the New York Sun in 1897.

Most Internet appliances that I've seen are simply dumbed-down

    People living and working in a business system cannot change it.
Their perspectives are foreshortened, their information gathering and
measurement systems reinforce the past, and their incentives encourage
continuity.  Archimedes proclaimed, 'Give me where to stand, and I will move
the earth.'  But where should those who might change a business system be
standing?
    The answer is that every organization needs two business systems.
Borrowing a term from linguistics, we shall call them the 'surface system'
and the 'deep system.'  The surface system is comprised of the organized
tasks of the business processes, with their attendant jobs, structures,
systems, and values.  But this surface system is in periodic need of major
change.  Accomplishing that change is the job of the deep system.
    The deep system creates no customer value; it makes no products and
delivers no services.  It doesn't process orders, develop new products, or
create value for customers.  Rather it monitors, governs, adjusts, and
reforms the surface system that does create customer value.  A company's
deep system bears the responsibility for detecting external changes,
determining what those changes mean, and intervening to modify or transform
the surface system accordingly.  The deep system, working beneath the
surface, embodies the capacity to change.
    The deep system continually hurls challenges: Is this still the
right way or the best way to do things?  If not, what is?  The deep system
ensures that the appropriate internal change--moderate or radical--takes
place, shaping and reshaping the organization to take account of, and
whenever possible take advantage of, ongoing external change.

    Distance changes utterly when you take the world on foot.  A mile
becomes a long way, two miles literally considerable, ten miles
whopping, fifty miles at the very limits of conception.  The world,
you realize, is enormous in a way that only you and a small community
of fellow hikers know.  Planetary scale is your little secret.
    Life takes on a neat simplicity, too.  Time ceases to have any
meaning.  When it is dark, you go to bed, and when it is light again
you get up, and everything in between is just in between.  It's quite
wonderful, really.
    You have no engagements, commitments, obligations, or duties; no
special ambitions and only the smallest, least complicated of wants;
you exist in tranquil tedium, serenely beyond the reach of
exasperation, 'far removed from the seats of strife,' as the early
explorer and botanist William Bartram put it.  All that is required
of you is a willingness to trudge.
    There is no point in hurrying because you are not actually going
anywhere.  However far or long you plod, you are always in the same
place: in the woods.  It's where you were yesterday, where you will
be tomorrow.  The woods is one boundless singularity.  Every bend in
the path presents a prospect indistinguishable from every other, every
glimpse into the trees the same tangled mass.  For all you know, your
route could describe a very large, pointless circle.  In a way, it
would hardly matter.

    The small and elite group of scientists who create most of the
flavor in most of the food now consumed in the United States are
called 'flavorists.'  They draw on a number of disciplines in their
work: biology, psychology, physiology, and organic chemistry.  A
flavorist is a chemist with a trained nose and a poetic sensibility.
Flavors are created by blending scores of different chemicals in
tiny amounts--a process governed by scientific principles but
demanding a fair amount of art.  In an age when delicate aromas and
microwave ovens do not easily co-exist, the job of the flavorist is
to conjure illusions about processed food and, in the words of one
flavor company's literature, to ensure 'consumer likeability.'  The
flavorists with whom I spoke were discreet, in keeping with the
dictates of their trade.  They were also charming, cosmopolitan, and
ironic.  They not only enjoyed fine wine but could identify the
chemicals that give each grape its unique aroma.  One flavorist
compared his work to composing music.  A well-made flavor compound
will have a 'top note' that is often followed by a 'dry-down' and a
'leveling-off,' with different chemicals responsible for each stage.
The taste of a food can be radically altered by minute changes in the
flavoring combination.  'A little odor goes a long way,' one
flavorist told me.
    In order to give a processed food a taste that consumers will
find appealing, a flavorist must always consider the food's
'mouthfeel'--the unique combination of textures and chemical
interactions that affect how the flavor is perceived.  Mouthfeel can
be adjusted through the use of various fats, gums, starches,
emulsifiers, and stabilizers.  The aroma chemicals in a food can be
precisely analyzed, but the elements that make up mouthfeel are much
harder to measure.  How does one quantify a pretzel's hardness, a
french fry's crispness?  Food technologists are now conducting basic
research in rheology, the branch of physics that examines the flow and
deformation of materials.  A number of companies sell sophisticated
devices that attempt to measure mouthfeel.  The TA.XT2i Texture
Analyzer, produced by the Texture Technologies Corporation, of
Scarsdale, New York, performs calculations based on data derived from
as many as 250 separate probes.  It is essentially a mechanical mouth.
It gauges the most-important rheological properties of a food--bounce,
creep, breaking point, density, crunchiness, chewiness, gumminess,
lumpiness, rubberiness, springiness, slipperiness, smoothness,
softness, wetness, juiciness, spreadability, springback, and tackiness.

    If the primary effect of the media in the late twentieth century was
to turn nearly everything that passed across their screens into
entertainment, the secondary and ultimately more significant effect was
to force nearly everything to turn itself into entertainment in order to
attract media attention.  Daniel Boorstin had coined the term 'pseudo-
event' to describe events that had been concocted by public relations
practitioners to get attention from the press.  Movie premieres,
publishing parties, press conferences, balloon crossings, sponsored
sporting contests, award ceremonies, demonstrations and hunger strikes,
to name just a few examples, all were synthetic, manufactured pseudo-
events that wouldn't have existed if someone hadn't been seeking
publicity and if the media hadn't been seeking something to fill their
pages and airwaves, preferably something entertaining.
    But the idea of pseudo-events almost seemed quaint by the late
twentieth century.  Most people realized that the object of virtually
everyone in public life of any sort was to attract the media and that
everyone from the top movie stars to the parents of septuplets now had
to have a press agent to promote them.  What most people were also coming
to realize, if only by virtue of how much the media had grown, was that
pseudo-events had proliferated to such an extent that one could hardly
call them events anymore because there were no longer any seams between
them and the rest of life, no way of separating the pseudo from the
so-called authentic.  Almost everything in life had appropriated the
techniques of public relations to gain access to the media, so that it
wasn't the pseudo-event one was talking about anymore when one cited the
cleverness of PR men and women: it was pseudo-life.
    Yet not even pseudo-life did full justice to the modern condition.
That's because the media were not just passively recording the public
performances and manipulations of others, even when life was nothing but
manipulations.  Having invited these performances in the first place,
the media justified covering them because they were receiving media
attention, which is every bit as convoluted as it sounds.  The result
was to make of modern society one giant Heisenberg effect, in which the
media were not really reporting what people did; they were reporting
what people did to get media attention.  In other words, as life was
increasingly being lived for the media, so the media were increasingly
covering themselves and their impact on life.

    When you're in a world of experts and so-called professionals, the
common sense of the people is marginalized.
    I'll give you an example.  We're talking about building a building
not too far from where I live, in this warehouse district.  It's an old,
totally undistinguished warehouse in what has been designated a historic
district.  So we're working up the Environmental Impact Report, and you hire
a consultant.  The consultant is this young lady who says, 'The developer
wants to tear this whole warehouse down and build an eight-story building,
and that would have a negative impact on the historic warehouse district.'
    I say, 'Wait a minute.  Why?  It's an eight-story building.  What's
different?  Why do you say it's negative?  Why isn't it positive?  It will
bring more people -- there are not enough people down here.'
    'No,' she said, 'in my professional judgment...'  And that is given
weight by the courts.  Her opinion could have more sway than the city
council, the manager, the mayor, and all the people of Oakland put together.
    That's amazing.  That's what I call 'expertise versus common sense.'
What do they call those guys in Russia: the nomenklatura?  The class of
folks who run things.  I think that's an important issue: reclaiming the
power of ordinary people to control their lives.  Every time we turn around,
we've got some kind of a state or federal rule or regulation.
    'In my professional judgment...'  That whole academic discipline was
probably created less than 25 years ago, and that lore -- I call it lore;
these are like stories you tell around the campfire -- is then raised to
the level of legal significance with greater authority than the vote of the
people and the elected representatives.  The people have lost their
democratic right to make a decision over the shape of their lives, and you
can find that happening on a lot of issues more controversial than historic
preservation.

    Technology is often defined as the creation of tools to gain control
over the environment.  However, this definition is not entirely sufficient.
Humans are not alone in their use or even creation of tools.  Orangutans in
Sumatra's Suaq Balimbing swamp make tools out of long sticks to break open
termite nests.  Crows fashion tools from sticks and leaves.  The leaf-cutter
ant mixes dry leaves with its saliva to create a paste.  Crocodiles use tree
roots to anchor dead prey.
    What is uniquely human is the application of knowledge--recorded
knowledge--to the fashioning of tools.  The knowledge base represents the
genetic code for the evolving technology.  And as technology has evolved,
the means for recording this knowledge base has also evolved, from the oral
traditions of antiquity to the written design logs of nineteenth-century
craftsmen to the computer-assisted design databases of the 1990s.
    Technology also implies a transcendence of the materials used to
comprise it.  When the elements of an invention are assembled in just the
right way, they produce an enchanting effect that goes beyond the mere
parts.  When Alexander Graham Bell accidentally wire-connected two moving
drums and solenoids (metal cores wrapped in wire) in 1875, the result
transcended the materials he was working with.  For the first time, a human
voice was transported, magically it seemed, to a remote location.  Most
assemblages are just that: random assemblies.  But when materials--and in
the case of modern technology, information--are assembled in just the
right way, transcendence occurs.  The assembled object becomes far greater
than the sum of its parts.

    The bug, that perverse and elusive malfunctioning of hardware and
later of software, was born in the nineteenth century.  It was already
accepted shop slang as early as 1878, when Thomas Edison described his
style of invention in a letter to a European representative: 'The first
step is an intuition and it comes with a burst, then difficulties arise--
this thing gives out and then that--"Bugs"--as such little faults and
difficulties are called--show themselves, and months of intense watching,
study and labor are requisite before commercial success--or failure--is
certainly reached.'
    Edison implies that this use of 'bug' had not begun in his laboratory
but was already standard jargon.  The expression seems to have originated
as telegrapher's slang.  Western Union and other telegraph companies, with
their associated branch offices, formed America's first high-technology
system.  About the time of Edison's letter, Western Union had over twelve
thousand stations, and it was their condition that probably helped inspire
the metaphor.  City offices were filthy, and clerks exchanged verse about
the gymnastics of insects cavorting in the cloakrooms.  When, in 1945, a
moth in a relay crashed the Mark II electromechanical calculator that the
Navy was running at Harvard--it can still be seen taped in the original
logbook--the bug metaphor had already been around for at least seventy-
five years.

    The year 1950 was the last full cry of urban America, at least on
the surface.  It was the year many of the cities visited in this book
reached their historic peaks in population.  Everybody was working, in folk
memory, and in fact.  Armies clad in overalls poured out of plants at
quitting time or watched as the next shift filed in.  Houses cost a couple
of thousand bucks, or in high-cost cities some fifteen thousand.  The
mortgage was often less than a hundred a month.  The teeming ethnic ghettos
of the early century had given way to a more comfortable life, with
religion and ethnicity, race and class still used as organizing principles
for the neighborhood.  The rough edges of the immigrant 'greenhorns' were
worn smooth, and a confident younger generation now entered a fuller,
richer American life.  Grandma and Grandpa had their accents and old ways
intact, and still mumbled sayings in the language your parents used when
they didn't want you to understand.  You could still find Il Progresso,
Freiheit, Norske Tidende, and Polish Daily Zgoda on the newsstands, but the
neighborhoods themselves were no longer alien places.  It was the ghetto,
yes, but made benign by assimilation.
    It was this world that the first surge tide into the suburbs left
behind.  They were people for whom the city had done its work, making
Americans out of families from Dublin to Donetsk.  America had given the
urban young educations, and expectations.  For many, those expectations had
been nurtured through world war and economic depression.  Something better
was needed for the baby boomers.
    Today we look back on it all in hurt and wonder.  How did this
happen?  Where did that good life go?  When an accidental detour or a missed
expressway exit brings us into contact with the world we left behind, we
can still place all the blame firmly and squarely elsewhere.  The shuttered
factories and collapsing row houses, the vacant storefronts and rutted
streets are regarded with the same awe reserved for the scenes of natural
disasters.  We look out on a world that somehow, in the American collective
memory, destroyed itself.

    The traditional image of Asian countries--and the one I held before
we moved there--was of overwhelmingly poor societies: city dwellers
starving in the streets and farmers slaving to raise barely enough rice
to feed a family, while a tiny clique of well-connected magnates lived
behind barbed-wire fences in ornate mansions.  Today, those scenes can
still be found in parts of East Asia.  But for the most part, the Asian
countries are building a huge middle class, in which most people have
about as much as everybody else.
    Japan has been the model; when Japan became a rich country, it did
so in ways that spread the wealth broadly and evenly.  In opinion polls
today, more than 90 percent of the Japanese people describe themselves
as 'middle class.'  In the other 'high-performing Asian economies' the
economic boom has also been broadly distributed...
    You can legitimately question whether equal distribution of a
nation's wealth is a sign of social success.  The American dream, in
economic terms, at least, has generally been the dream of enormous
success--not of making as much money as everybody else but rather of
getting really rich.  And that dream has been one of the key reasons
for the dynamism and resiliency of the United States over the decades.
On the other hand, the egalitarian distribution of wealth, and the
resulting sense that everybody is getting a relatively fair shake, is
surely one of the reasons that Asian countries have civil and stable
societies.

    This idea of breaking the world into pieces and then explaining
the pieces in terms of smaller pieces is called reductionism.  It
would be perfectly justified to consider Murray Gell-Mann, the father
of the quark, to be the century's arch-reductionist.  But very early
on, long before mushy notions of holism became trendy, Gell-Mann
appreciated an important truth: While you can reduce downward, that
doesn't automatically mean you can explain upward.  People can be
divided into cells, cells into molecules, molecules into atoms, atoms
into electrons and nuclei, nuclei into subatomic particles, and those
into still tinier things called quarks.  But, true as that may be,
there is nothing written in the laws of subatomic physics that can be
used to explain higher-level phenomena like human behavior.  There is
no way that one can start with quarks and predict that cellular life
would emerge and evolve over the eons to produce physicists.  Reducing
downward is vastly easier than explaining upward--a truth that bears
repeating.

    In the centuries preceding the introduction of the printing press,
those who held power reinforced it by uses of language that mystified the
powerless and kept them subservient.  Even more so in today's world, power
is inextricably tied to the use of language, and today's priesthood of
professionals in many fields employs jargon-fueled mystification.  That is a
political use of language that deliberately excludes the 'powerless' lay
audience from participation.  The doctor whose technical terms confuse, no
less than the politician whose equivocations obfuscate, the lawyer whose
terms intimidate, and the accountant whose explanations obscure, is taking
advantage of audiences through what are called 'gatekeeper' uses of
language.  They include euphemisms, jargon and other devices designed to
prevent rather than augment the free flow of knowledge.
    Lawyers have been particularly egregious in this practice.
Gatekeeper language also frequently masks what physicians do especially in
circumstances that can be fraught with emotion.  A relative of a cancer
patient, seeking straight and hard informational answers to questions --
how bad is the situation, how much time does she have left, is there any
hope -- was informed by her doctor that his relative's cancer was
'treatable' and her prognosis was 'guarded...'
    The philosopher Jrgen Habermas provides an insight into the
political nature of gatekeeper uses of language through his identification
of the 'scientization of the public sphere,' a process now occurring in
many societies.  In this trend, elites effectively disqualify members of the
public from being able to participate in policy discussions by insisting
that only specialists can really understand what is going on.  When
politicians come to believe that only they can understand what is going on
in the high councils of government, and that their job is to translate it
for us and to protect themselves in the process, the language they aim at
the electorate takes on more and more aspects of purposeful deceit.

    We live with strangers.  Those we love most, with whom we share
a shelter, a table, a bed, remain mysterious.  Wherever lives overlap
and flow together, there are depths of unknowing.  Parents and children,
partners, siblings, and friends repeatedly surprise us, revealing the
need to learn where we are most at home.  We even surprise ourselves
in our own becoming, moving through the cycles of our lives.  There is
strangeness hidden in the familiar.
    At the same time there is familiarity hidden in the strange.  We can
look with curiosity and respect at the faces of men and women we have
never met.  Learning to recognize these strangers with whom we share an
increasingly crowded and interdependent world, we can imagine ourselves
joined in a single family, perhaps by a marriage between adventurous
grandchildren.
    Strangers marry strangers, whether they have been playmates for
years or never meet before the wedding day.  They continue to surprise
each other through the evolutions of love and the growth of affection.
Lovers, gay and straight, begin in strangeness and often, for the zest
of it, find ways to increase their differences.
    Children arrive like aliens from outer space, their needs and
feelings inaccessible, sharing no common language, yet for all their
strangeness we greet them with love.  Traditionally, the strangeness of
infants has been understood as temporary, the strangeness of incomplete
beings who are expected to become predictable and comprehensible.  This
expectation has eased the transition from generation to generation, the
passing on of knowledge and responsibility, on which every human society
depends.  Yet the gap between parent and child, like the gap between
partners, is not left behind with the passage of time.  Today, in a
world of rapid change, it is increasing, shifting into new rhythms still
to be explored.

    MAKE THE PIE HIGHER
    by George W. Bush

    I think we all agree, the past is over.
    This is still a dangerous world.
    It's a world of madmen and uncertainty
    and potential mental losses.

    Rarely is the question asked
    Is our children learning?
    Will the highways of the internet
    become more few?
    How many hands have I shaked?

    They misunderestimate me.
    I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.

    I know that the human being
    and the fish can coexist.

    Families is where our nation finds hope,
    where our wings take dream.

    Put food on your family!
    Knock down the tollbooth!
    Vulcanize Society!

    Make the pie higher!  Make the pie higher!

    The Hutterites (who came out of the same tradition as the Amish
and the Mennonites) have a strict policy that every time a colony
approaches 150, they split it in two and start a new one.  "Keeping
things under 150 just seems to be the best and most efficient way to
manage a group of people," Bill Gross, one of the leaders of a
Hutterite colony outside Spokane told me.  "When things get larger
than that, people become strangers to one another."
    The Hutterites, obviously, didn't get this idea from contemporary
evolutionary psychology.  They've been following the 150 rule for
centuries...  At 150, the Hutterites believe, something happens--
something indefinable but very real--that somehow changes the nature
of community overnight.  "In smaller groups people are a lot closer.
They're knit together, which is very important if you want to be
effective and successful at community life," Gross said.  "If you
get too large, you don't have enough work in common.  You don't have
enough things in common, and then you start to become strangers and
that close-knit fellowship starts to get lost."
    Gross spoke from experience.  He had been in Hutterite colonies
that had come near to that magic number and seen first-hand how
things had changed.  "What happens when you get that big is that the
group starts, just on its own, to form a sort of clan."  He made a
gesture with his hands, as if to demonstrate division.  "You get two
or three groups within the larger group.  That is something you
really try to prevent, and when it happens it is a good time to
branch out."

~
    I think a power to do something is of value.  Whether the result
is a good thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the
power is a value.  Once in Hawaii I was taken to see a Buddhist
temple.  In the temple a man said, "I am going to tell you something
that you will never forget."  And then he said, "To every man is
given the key to the gates of heaven.  The same key opens the gates
of hell."
    And so it is with science.  In a way it is a key to the gates of
heaven, and the same key opens the gates of hell, and we do not have
any instructions as to which is which gate.  Shall we throw away the
key and never have a way to enter the gates of heaven?  Or shall we
struggle with the problem of which is the best way to use the key?
That is, of course, a very serious question, but I think that we
cannot deny the value of the key to the gates of heaven.
    All the major problems of the relations between society and
science lie in this same area.  When the scientist is told that he
must be more responsible for his effects on society, it is the
applications of science that are referred to.  If you work to develop
nuclear energy you must realize also that it can be used harmfully.
Therefore, you would expect that, in a discussion of this kind by a
scientist, this would be the most important topic.  But I will not
talk about it further.  I think that to say these are scientific
problems is an exaggeration.  They are far more humanitarian problems.
The fact that how to work the power is clear, but how to control it is
not, is something not so scientific and is not something that the
scientist knows so much about.

    Among the devices that we use to impose order upon a complicated
(but by no means unstructured) world, classification--or the division
of items into categories based on perceived similarities--must rank
as the most general and most pervasive of all.  And no strategy of
classification cuts deeper--while providing such an even balance of
benefits and difficulties--than our propensity for division by two,
or dichotomy.
    Some basic attributes of surrounding nature do exist as complem-
entary pairings--two large lights in the sky representing day and
night; two sexes that must couple their opposing parts to produce a
continuity of generations--so we might argue that dichotomization
amounts to little more than good observation of the external world.
But far more often than not, dichotomization leads to misleading or
even dangerous oversimplification.  People and beliefs are not either
good or evil (with the second category ripe for burning); and
organisms are not either plant or animal, vertebrate or invertebrate,
human or beast.  We seem so driven to division by two, even in
clearly inappropriate circumstances, that I must agree with several
schools of thought (most notably Claude Levi-Strauss and the French
structuralists) in viewing dichotomization more as an inherent
mechanism of the brain's operation than as a valid perception of
external reality.

    The human race has reached a critical time in its social evolution
when it has no choice but to make peace with its biological origins and
to learn how to live once again as a member and partner of the natural
community rather than as its dominator and destroyer.  In other words,
we must rediscover how to live as our savage ancestors once lived--in
nature, rather apart from it, much less above it.  We must, that is,
invent the civilized analogue of the hunter-gatherer way of life, the
only sustainable mode of human existence the planet has ever known.
Suggesting that we live in a much simpler and more natural way does not
imply a return to the Stone Age or anything like it: we have many
possibilities open to us that were not available to our forebears, for
we have been enormously enriched and enlightened by the long experience
of civilization (or at least so one hopes).  Nevertheless, how such a
profound transformation of civilization toward a more experienced and
wiser savagery can be achieved is obviously an immensely difficult
question, because it will clearly entail radical changes in every aspect
of our way of life.
    Just how radical is suggested by one of the most poignant and
pointed critiques of modern civilization ever uttered.  Breaking into
a filmed interview on the destruction of the Amazon rain forest, an
anonymous Kayapo Indian woman shouted, "We don't want your dams.  Your
mothers did not hold you enough.  You are all orphans."  It is perhaps
too simple to say that the good society is one in which your mother--
and by extension your father, your community, and indeed your entire way
of life--holds you enough, so that you grow up feeling that the world is
a good place and that life is intrinsically satisfying just as it is and
that there is thus no need to make it more satisfying by accumulating
endless wealth and power at others' expense.  But this at least points
in the right direction: to become more experienced and wiser savages, to
meet the real political challenge of the twenty-first century, we shall
have to create cultures so rich and nurturing that we would have no need
to pursue happiness; we could simply enjoy it.

    Memory's malfunctions can be divided into seven fundamental transgressions
or 'sins.'  Just like the ancient seven deadly sins, the memory sins occur
frequently in everyday life and can have serious consequences for all of us.
Transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking are sins of omission: we fail to
bring to mind a desired fact, event, or idea.  Transience refers to a weakening
or loss of memory over time.  It's probably not difficult for you to remember
now what you have been doing for the past several hours.  But if I ask you
about the same activities six weeks, six months, or six years from now, chances
are you'll remember less and less.
    Absent-mindedness involves a breakdown at the interface between attention
and memory.  Absent-minded memory errors--misplacing keys or eyeglasses, or
forgetting a lunch appointment--typically occur because we are preoccupied with
distracting issues or concerns, and don't focus attention on what we need to
remember.
    The third sin, blocking, entails a thwarted search for information that we
may be desperately trying to retrieve.  We've all failed to produce a name to
accompany a familiar face.  This frustrating experience happens even though we
are attending carefully to the task at hand, and even though the desired name
has not faded from our minds--as we become acutely aware when we unexpectedly
retrieve the blocked name hours or days later.
    In contrast to these three sins of omission, the next four sins of
misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence are all sins of
commission: some form of memory is present, but it is either incorrect or
unwanted.  The sin of misattribution involves assigning a memory to the wrong
source: mistaking fantasy for reality, or incorrectly remembering that a friend
told you a bit of trivia that you actually read about in a newspaper.
Misattribution is far more common than most people realize, and has potentially
profound implications in legal settings.  The related sin of suggestibility
refers to memories that are implanted as a result of leading questions,
comments, or suggestions when a person is trying to call up a past experience.
    The sin of bias reflects the powerful influences of our current knowledge
and beliefs on how we remember our pasts.  We often edit or entirely rewrite
our previous experiences--unknowingly and unconsciously--in light of what we
now know or believe.  The result can be a skewed rendering of a specific
incident, or even of an extended period in our lives, which says more about how
we feel now than about what happened then.
    The seventh sin -- persistence -- entails repeated recall of disturbing
information or events that we would prefer to banish from our minds altogether:
remembering what we cannot forget, even though we wish that we could.  Recall
the last time that you suddenly awoke at 3:00 a.m., unable to keep out of your
mind a painful blunder on the job or a disappointing result on an important
exam.  In more extreme cases of serious depression or traumatic experience,
persistence can be disabling and even life-threatening.

     and Remembers."

    We now all live in a society marked by increasing, not decreasing,
interconnection and mutual reliance.  Each of our lives is affected by
more people than ever before.  We generally need the cooperation of
more people than ever to accomplish even those goals we set for
ourselves.  This insight needs no elaborate demonstration; one is
reminded of it with every smoggy breath we take, and every time we step
on an airplane and ponder how our life depends on the competent,
attentive behavior of dozens of strangers, from the pilot to the air
traffic controller to the ground mechanic who was supposed to inspect
the extent of the metal fatigue on the wings.  Technology increases the
links that tie people together, voluntarily or not, and the complexity
of our economic system and the organizations we work for multiplies
these linkages.
    To exercise control over what happens to you as an individual, you
must be involved with others in a process that decides what happens to
you and your fellow citizens collectively.  We can no longer separate
the quality of personal life from the quality of social life.  To
preserve private space, we must also preserve the commons.
    That is one reason why even in a society so seduced by and attached
to autonomy, many people are now getting fed up with what can only be
called acts of vandalism against the public space.  Threatening,
disrespectful, wanton, and manifestly selfish acts--from the warfare of
crack dealers and gangs to the shameless greed of the S&L thieves and
the destruction of our very environment by the industrial polluters--
are poisonous to everyone, not just those directly harmed.  Of course,
we pay for such things as taxpayers and as consumers, but that is not
the most important cost.  All of us are morally impoverished by these
assaults on the quality and integrity of our common life.

    Historically, consumer acceptance of new technologies has been
slow and cumbersome, delaying anticipated profits by decades.
Indeed, consumer acceptance of any innovation is typically slow,
despite extraordinary benefits and convenience.
    When cake mixes were first created, they required consumers to
only add water--a major behavioral shift.  Consumers felt a cake
made with such a mix could not possibly be as good as a homemade
cake.  So cake mix formulas were revised to require the addition of
an egg and milk.  The new mixes met with great success, because the
behavior shift required of consumers was minor.  Eventually some
consumers became comfortable adding only water (some never will).

Victory at all costs--Victory in spite of all terrors--Victory, however
long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.

    Yesterday, December 7, 1941--a day which will live in infamy--the
United states of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by
naval and air forces of the empire of Japan...  The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and
military forces.  I regret to tell you that very many American lives
have been lost.  In addition, American ships have been reported
torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu...  Japan
has therefore undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the
Pacific area.  The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves.
The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and
well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our
nation.
    As Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all
measures be taken for our defense, that always will our whole nation
remember the character of the onslaught against us.  No matter how long
it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American
people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.
    I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the
people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the
uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.  Hostilities exist.  There is no
blinking at the fact that our people, our territory and our interests
are in grave danger.  With confidence in our armed forces, with the
unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable
triumph.  So help us God.

    The liberties of our country, the freedom of our civil constitution, are
worth defending at all hazards; and it is our duty to defend them against all
attacks.  We have received them as a fair inheritance from our worthy
ancestors: they purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of
treasure and blood, and transmitted them to us with care and diligence.
    It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation,
enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by
violence without a struggle, or be cheated out of them by the artifices of
false and designing men.
    Of the latter we are in most danger at present; let us therefore be aware
of it.  Let us contemplate our forefathers and posterity; and resolve to
maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for the sake of the
latter.
    Instead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts we have already made,
which is the wish of our enemies, the necessity of the times, more than ever,
calls for our utmost circumspection, deliberation, fortitude, and perseverance.
Let us remember that 'if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty,
we encourage it, and involve others in our doom.'  It is a very serious
consideration, which should deeply impress our minds, that millions yet unborn
may be the miserable sharers in the event.

Herr, "map-making.  But we've carried it much further than you.  What
do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?"
    "About six inches to the mile."
    "Only six inches!" exclaimed Mein Herr.  "We very soon got to six
yards to the mile.  Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile.  And
then came the grandest idea of all!  We actually made a map of the
country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!"
    "Have you used it much?" I enquired.
    "It has never been spread out, yet," said Mein Herr: "the farmers
objected; they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out
the sunlight!  So we now use the country itself, as its own map, and
I assure you it does nearly as well."

    The majority of important television commercials take the form of
religious parables organized around a coherent theology.  Like all religious
parables, they put forward a concept of sin, intimations of the way to
redemption, and a vision of Heaven.  They also suggest what are the roots of
evil and what are the obligations of the holy.
    Consider, for example, the Parable of the Ring Around the Collar.  This
is to television scripture what the Parable of the Prodigal Son is to the
Bible, which is to say it is an archetype containing most of the elements of
form and content that recur in the genre.
    The narrative structure of the Parable of the Ring Around the Collar is,
indeed, comfortably traditional.  The story has a beginning, a middle, and an
end.  A married couple is depicted in some relaxed setting--a restaurant, say--
in which they are enjoying each other's company and generally having a
wonderful time.  But then a waitress approaches their table, notices that the
man has a dirty collar, stares at it boldly, sneers with cold contempt, and
announces to all within hearing the nature of his transgression.  The man is
humiliated and glares at his wife with scorn, for she is the source of his
shame.  She, in turn, assumes an expression of self-loathing mixed with a
touch of self-pity...
    The parable continues by showing the wife at home using a detergent
that never fails to eliminate dirt around the collars of men's shirts...
    In television-commercial parables, the root cause of evil is
"Technological Innocence", a failure to know the particulars of the
beneficent accomplishments of industrial progress...
    Technological innocence refers not only to ignorance of detergents,
drugs, sanitary napkins, cars, salves, and foodstuffs, but also to
ignorance of technical machinery such as savings banks and transportation
systems.

Ten point list of lessons learned
from the high-tech industry failures during 2001:

  1) Prediction tools must improve.
  2) It's hugely difficult to build chicken and egg simultaneously.
  3) Venture capital firms' demands that startups generate $50 million
     in revenue within three years were unrealistic.
  4) Companies used narrowcast to broadcast.
  5) Free is folly.
  6) We all, like sheep, will go astray (with enough pressure).
  7) Many startups were fundamentally uncreative and "un-Internet."
  8) Too early to market?  Too bad.
  9) New stuff doesn't replace old.
 10) Nothing changes overnight.

    The English word "way" is perhaps the nearest translation that we can
make to the Chinese word tao.  It is usually pronounced "dow."  The Tao
means many things.  Primarily, it means the way of nature, the process of
the universe.  But it also means a way of life, a way of living in
accordance with that process.  We have lost the idea that our occupations
are vocations.  Our idea of an occupation is that it is a way of making
money.  We make a very, very destructive division between work and play.
We spend eight hours, or whatever it may be, at work in order to earn the
money to enjoy ourselves in the other eight hours.  And that is a perfectly
ridiculous way of living.  It is much better to be very poor indeed than to
do something so stupid as boring ourselves and wasting ourselves for eight
hours in order to be able to enjoy ourselves the other eight hours.  The
result of this fantastic division between work and play is that work
becomes drudgery, and play becomes empty.  When we say that our occupation
should also be our vocation, we are speaking of a conception of life within
which work and play should be identical.
    It is interesting that Hindus, when they speak of the creation of the
universe, do not call it the work of God, they call it the play of God,
the Vishnu-lila, lila meaning "play."  And they look upon the whole
manifestation of all the universes as a play, as a sport, as a kind of
dance--lila perhaps being somewhat related to our word lilt.  We in the
West have tended to lose the idea of our work, our profession, as being a
way, a tao.
    Now, mind you, these ways I am talking about in Asia are not followed
by an enormous number of people, except in a kind of nominal, superficial
way.  And I am not trying to make any vast comparisons between Asian society
and Western society or to say that the total Asian way of life is superior
to ours.  I do not think it is, but I do not think it is necessarily
inferior, either; it is just different.  But the fact remains that there is
an aspect of Asian religion and philosophy that is very subdued in Western
religion and philosophy, so that you might say that the Way, in the sense of
the Chinese Tao, does not quite exist in the West, in any recognizable form.
It does exist, yes.  It exists unofficially, it exists occasionally, but it
is never clearly recognized.

    Whenever a person walks in on the middle of a film or a conversation, or
starts a new friendship, opens a book, takes a new job, or moves to a new
city, his first need is to orient himself.  We all must know, in a general
way, what to expect so that we can plan and respond intelligently and feel
comfortable.  And although all animals work with their senses and brains to
orient themselves, human being do something unique.  We live less simply and
directly in the world than do other animals.  We make a version of a world,
an interpretation of it, and then we live in that.  The degree of comfort
and success that we achieve in our lives depends on how well that
interpretation suits our circumstances.
    Another way to state this idea is that genetically built into people is
a special organizing mode of perception.  The philosopher Susanne Langer
calls this mode transformational: we are co-creators of our own perceptions.
In the very act of physically perceiving, we interpret; we transform the raw
data gathered by our senses into complex symbolic meanings.  We literally
cannot function and survive without seeing in our world evidence of order
and purpose.  We take nothing at face value; we systematize, explain, weave
a large network of connected meanings.
    While nonhuman animals toil for their lives, play, or lie in the sun--do
whatever is suitable for the moment--only people fret and practice and
struggle to achieve distant or abstract goals.  We are the only animals who
live partly removed from our immediate physical circumstances.  This
extravagance is the source of our language, art, science, music, religions,
philosophies: those things we value most. Aside from such direct physical
causes of death as hunger, exposure, old age, or disease, the one
circumstance we truly cannot survive is living in a raw, uninterpreted
place--in chaos.  Each of us either finds a meaning in some traditional
religion or philosophy or patches together one of his own, or else he
panics, loses the will to live, and, in one way or another perishes.

  Our happiness doesn't depend on somebody else's action or on anything
else.  It doesn't depend on our success, but rather on the effort we're
willing to put into everything we do.  Even if people disappoint or fail
us left and right, even if people turn against us, hurt us, lie about us,
don't understand us, even if they think they know everything about us and
judge us unfairly, they can't infringe upon our happiness.  True happiness
means that we have a deep-seated peace and tranquility that transcends all
the difficulties of life, that cannot be disturbed by the chaos and
warfare that might touch our lives.
  Digging in the trenches of a Nazi concentration camp Victor Frankl once
said to a fellow inmate: "This is where you've got to find your happiness--
right here in this trench, in this camp."  It is a simple matter of fact:
you can be just as happy in a concentration camp, horrific and terrible as
it surely is, as you can in any other circumstance in life.
  For this is where we're supposed to find our happiness--where we are
now, wherever that might happen to be, in all that we do, in whatever
circumstances we find ourselves.  Being happy involves the intense
struggle of entering intimately into all that we do.

    City people have a hard time handling the silences when they first
come out to the country.  After a certain period of solitude, I myself
experiencing an aloneness that is sometimes disturbing, but the country
eventually cleanses my spirit and purges my body of the sounds, fumes and
toxins of urban life.  I think cities feed psychological stress and tension
in many ways, including an overload of electrical forces and energy.  When
you go to a country cabin without electricity, you will be surprised at how
tensions fall away.
    Some practitioners advocate that urban dwellers removed from the
country find a space in the yard or the garden and dig a hole deep enough
to enfold the body.  Lie down in the hole.  Make sure your body can lie just
below the surface of the ground.  Stay in this hollow of earth.  You will be
surprised how rested you will feel simply because you have escaped for a
moment the man-made influences.  You have retreated for a moment to Mother
Earth's very simple electrical systems.  For the chemical and electrical
balance of the body to be calibrated, you have to stay close to the earth
itself, align yourself with its polarity so that your body can find harmony
between the interior world and the exterior universe.
    Once we become detached from nature, we begin to think we can do
without it.  The lights of the Great White Way overpower the stars.  It is
very hard to see the brightest constellation when you live in or near a
city.  The dark solitude of the country reunites you with the universe of
the stars.  The woods and hills restore in you something primal in yourself.
The sea's pulse sets your own heartbeat.

As a public company, and as a CEO, you have to worry about the stock price
to some extent.  But you figure out after a while that there are very few
things you can do in the short term that can positively impact stock price.
If you build a great company, the value of the company goes up.  That's very
important for employees to realize coming out of this age of day trading,
mass hysteria and "we're all going to be bazillionaires."  You've got to get
people saying: "Why are we really here?"  Well, we're here to build a great
company.  That takes time.  You may have a great day today and the stock goes
down, and you may have a horrible day tomorrow and the stock goes up.  Short
term, they don't have a lot to do with each other.  But over a long period of
time you build a great company, and it's going to be worth a lot.  Customers
will reward it.  Shareholders will reward it.  Employees will want to be a
part of it and beat our door down to want to work here.

Smokey the Bear Sutra

Once in the Jurassic about 150 million years ago,
the Great Sun Buddha in this corner of the Infinite
Void gave a Discourse to all the assembled elements
and energies: to the standing beings, the walking beings,
the flying beings, and the sitting beings -- even grasses,
to the number of thirteen billion, each one born from a
seed, assembled there: a Discourse concerning
Enlightenment on the planet Earth.

"In some future time, there will be a continent called
America. It will have great centers of power called
such as Pyramid Lake, Walden Pond, Mt. Rainier, Big Sur,
Everglades, and so forth; and powerful nerves and channels
such as Columbia River, Mississippi River, and Grand Canyon
The human race in that era will get into troubles all over
its head, and practically wreck everything in spite of
its own strong intelligent Buddha-nature."

"The twisting strata of the great mountains and the pulsings
of volcanoes are my love burning deep in the earth.
My obstinate compassion is schist and basalt and
granite, to be mountains, to bring down the rain. In that
future American Era I shall enter a new form; to cure
the world of loveless knowledge that seeks with blind hunger:
and mindless rage eating food that will not fill it."

And he showed himself in his true form of

  SMOKEY THE BEAR

  a.. A handsome smokey-colored brown bear standing on his hind legs,
showing that he is aroused and
  watchful.

  b.. Bearing in his right paw the Shovel that digs to the truth beneath
appearances; cuts the roots of useless
  attach- ments, and flings damp sand on the fires of greed and war;

  c.. His left paw in the Mudra of Comradely Display -- indicating that all
creatures have the full right to live to
  their limits and that deer, rabbits, chipmunks, snakes, dandelions, and
lizards all grow in the realm of the
  Dharma;

  d.. Wearing the blue work overalls symbolic of slaves and laborers, the
countless men oppressed by a
  civilization that claims to save but often destroys;

  e.. Wearing the broad-brimmed hat of the West, symbolic of the forces that
guard the Wilderness, which is the
  Natural State of the Dharma and the True Path of man on earth: all true
paths lead through mountains --

  f.. With a halo of smoke and flame behind, the forest fires of the
kali-yuga, fires caused by the stupidity of
  those who think things can be gained and lost whereas in truth all is
contained vast and free in the Blue Sky
  and Green Earth of One Mind;

  g.. Round-bellied to show his kind nature and that the great earth has
food enough for everyone who loves her
  and trusts her;

  h.. Trampling underfoot wasteful freeways and needless suburbs; smashing
the worms of capitalism and
  totalitarianism;

  i.. Indicating the Task: his followers, becoming free of cars, houses,
canned foods, universities, and shoes;
  master the Three Mysteries of their own Body, Speech, and Mind; and
fearlessly chop down the rotten
  trees and prune out the sick limbs of this country America and then burn
the leftover trash.

Wrathful but Calm. Austere but Comic. Smokey the Bear will
Illuminate those who would help him; but for those who would hinder or
slander him,

  HE WILL PUT THEM OUT.

Thus his great Mantra:

  Namah samanta vajranam chanda maharoshana
  Sphataya hum traks ham nam

  "I DEDICATE MYSELF TO THE UNIVERSAL DIAMOND
  BE THIS RAGING FURY DESTROYED"

And he will protect those who love woods and rivers,
Gods and animals, hobos and madmen, prisoners and sick
people, musicians, playful women, and hopeful children:

And if anyone is threatened by advertising, air pollution, television,
or the police, they should chant SMOKEY THE BEAR'S WAR SPELL:

  DROWN THEIR BUTTS
  CRUSH THEIR BUTTS
  DROWN THEIR BUTTS
  CRUSH THEIR BUTTS

And SMOKEY THE BEAR will surely appear to put the enemy out
with his vajra-shovel.

  a.. Now those who recite this Sutra and then try to put it in practice
willl accumulate merit as countless as the
  sands of Arizona and Nevada.

Worldly acquisitions of wealth and the need of clinging to them, as well as

therefore it is that I am assuming this beggarly and penurious mode of life.

  Bodhidharma sat facing the wall.  The Second Patriarch, after standing
outside in the snow for so long, cut off his arm.  "My mind is not yet
at peace.  Please, Master, put my mind at peace."

  The Second Patriarch replied: "Although I have searched for my mind,
it is totally ungraspable."

    Our obsessions with history and prophecy perhaps reflect an inability
to comprehend the implications of geological time.  The mind's traditional
organization of duration into past, present, and future really has more
relevance to the five-thousand-year-old earth of the seventeenth century
than it does to the five-billion-year-old one of the twentieth.  Past and
future require certain limitations and symmetries to be meaningful--there
must be a plot or at least a story.  But time is really not much like a
story.  It is more like an ocean current that rises from imperfectly
perceived depths and flows into unseen distances.
    This immensity might seem to diminish the present--the living moment--
to utter insignificance, but actually the present looms much larger in
geological time than in historical time.  If time is a story, the present
is merely a hiatus between the significant events that were and will be.
If time is an ocean, however, the present is not less important than the
other moments, which stretch away on all sides, any more than a single
water molecule in an ocean is less important than the others.  In a sense
each living moment is the whole of time--an eternal present--because it
can't be set apart from all the other moments.

Among the maxims on Lord Naoshige's wall there was this one: "Matters of
great concern should be treated lightly."  Master Ittei commented, "Matters
of small concern should be treated seriously."  Among one's affairs there
should not be more than two or three matters of what one could call great
concern.  If these are deliberated upon during ordinary times, they can be
understood.  Thinking about things previously and then handling them lightly
when the time comes is what this is all about.  To face an event and solve
it lightly is difficult if you are not resolved beforehand, and there will
always be uncertainty in hitting your mark.  However, if the foundation is
laid previously, you can think of the saying, "Matters of great concern
should be treated lightly," as your basis for action.

There is something to be learned from a rainstorm.  When meeting with
a sudden shower, you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road.
But doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses, you still

perplexed, though you still get the same soaking.  This understanding
extends to everything.

    I refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the
river of life unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him.
I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the
starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and
brotherhood can never become a reality.
    I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must
spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hell of thermonuclear
destruction.  I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will
have the final word in reality.  This is why right temporarily defeated is
stronger than evil triumphant.
    I believe that even amid today's motor bursts and whining bullets,
there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow.  I believe that wounded
justice, lying prostrate on the blood-flowing streets of our nations, can
be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of
men.
    I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three
meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and
dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.  I believe that what
self-centered men have torn down, men other-centered can build up.  I still
believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be
crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed, and nonviolent redemptive
goodwill will proclaim the rule of the land.

I was unable to devote myself to the learning of this algebra and the continued
concentration upon it, because of obstacles in the vagaries of time which
hindered me; for we have been deprived of all the people of knowledge save for
a group, small in number, with many troubles, whose concern in life is to
snatch the opportunity, when time is asleep, to devote themselves meanwhile to
the investigation and perfection of a science; for the majority of people who
imitate philosophers confuse the true with the false, and they do nothing but
deceive and pretend knowledge, and they do not use what they know of the
sciences except for base and material purposes; and if they see a certain
person seeking for the right and preferring the truth, doing his best to refute
the false and untrue and leaving aside hypocrisy and deceit, they make a fool
of him and mock him.

    The Founders of the American nation were one of the most creative
groups in modern history.  Some among them, especially in recent years,
have been condemned for their failures and weaknesses--for their racism,
sexism, compromises, and violations of principle.  And indeed moral
judgments are as necessary in assessing the lives of these people as of
any others.  But we are privileged to know and to benefit from the outcome
of their efforts, which they could only hopefully imagine, and ignore their
main concern: which was the possibility, indeed the probability, that their
creative enterprise--not to recast the social order but to transform the
political system--would fail: would collapse into chaos or autocracy.
Again and again they were warned of the folly of defying the received
traditions, the sheer unlikelihood that they, obscure people on the outer
borderlands of European civilization, knew better than the established
authorities that ruled them; that they could successfully create something
freer, ultimately more enduring than what was then known in the centers of
metropolitan life.
    Since we inherit and build on their achievements, we now know what the
established world of the eighteenth century flatly denied but which they
broke through convention to propose -- that absolute power need not be
indivisible but can be shared among states within a state and among
branches of government, and that the sharing of power and the balancing of
forces can create not anarchy but freedom.
    We know for certain what they could only experimentally and prayerfully
propose--that formal, written constitutions, upheld by judicial bodies, can
effectively constrain the tyrannies of both executive force and populist
majorities.
    We know, because they had the imagination to perceive it, that there
is a sense, mysterious as it may be, in which human rights can be seen to
exist independent of privileges, gifts, and donations of the powerful, and
that these rights can somehow be defined and protected by the force of law.
    We casually assume, because they were somehow able to imagine, that
the exercise of power is no natural birthright but must be a gift of those
who are subject to it."

All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of
their motives there lies a mystery.  Writing a book is a horrible,
exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness.
One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on
by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.

Did you ever see dishonest calluses on a man's hands?  Hardly.

Executives are like joggers.  If you stop a jogger, he goes on running

None but myself ever did me any harm.  I was, I may say, the only enemy to
myself: my own projects, that expedition to Moscow, and the accidents which
happened there, were the causes of my fall.  I must say, though, that those
who failed to oppose me, who readily agreed with me, accepted all my views,
and yielded easily to my opinions, were those who did me the most injury,
and were my worst enemies, because, by surrendering to me so easily, they
encouraged me to go too far...  I was then too powerful for any man, except
myself, to injure me.

There were two "Reigns of Terror", if we could but remember and consider it;
the one wrought murder in hot passions, the other in heartless cold blood;
the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one
inflicted death upon a thousand persons, the other upon a hundred million;
but our shudders are all for the horrors of the momentary Terror, so to
speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe compared with
lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty and heartbreak?  A city
cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief terror that we have
all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France
could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror--that
unspeakable bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see
in its vastness or pity as it deserves.

George Orwell, on why someone might write a book...

  1. Sheer egoism.  Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered
after death, to get your own back on grownups who snubbed you in childhood,
etc., etc.  It is humbug to pretend that this is not a motive, and a strong
one.  Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians,
lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen-in short, with the whole top crust
of humanity.  The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish.  After
the age of about thirty they abandon individual ambition and live chiefly for
others or are simply smothered under drudgery.  But there is also the minority
of gifted, willful people who are determined to live their own lives to the
end, and writers belong to this class.  Serious writers, I should say, are on
the whole more vain and self-centered than journalists, though less interested
in money.
  2. Esthetic enthusiasm.  Perception of beauty in the external world, or, on
the other hand, in words and their right arrangement.  Pleasure in the impact
of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good
story.  Desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not
to be missed.  Above the level of a railway guide, no book is quite free from
esthetic considerations.
  3. Historical impulse.  Desire to see things as they are, to find out true
facts and store them up for the use of posterity.
  4. Political purpose -- using the word "political" in the widest possible
sense.  Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other
people's idea of the kind of society that they should strive after.  Once
again, no book is genuinely free from political bias.  The opinion that art
should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.

Engineering can be seen as a family of paths crossing a solution space--in
this case a space defined by all the possible arrangements and combinations
of geometry, time, and material properties that might satisfy the particular
specifications of a design.  Filtering a good design out of these possibilities
by simple, direct calculation is impossible both because of the enormous number
of variables and because there are always elements in the specifications--like
aesthetics or ergonomics or compatibility with the corporate image--that can't
be reduced to a number or folded into a common denominator.  What humans do in
these cases is: think up a completely wrong (but sincerely felt) approach to
the problem, jump in, fail, and then do an autopsy.  Each failure contains
encrypted somewhere on its body directions for the next jump: "strengthen this
part," "tie this down next time," "buy a better battery."  Good engineering is
not a matter of creativity or centering or grounding or inspiration or lateral
thinking, as useful as those might be, but of decoding the clever, even witty,
messages solution space carves on the corpses of the ideas in which you
believed with all your heart, and then building the road to the next message.

The car as we know it is on the way out.  To a large extent, I deplore

In Buddhism, both learning and practice are extremely important, and they must
go hand in hand.  Without knowledge, just to rely on faith, faith, and more

practice, is also of no use.  It is necessary to combine knowledge born from
study with sincere practice in our daily lives.  These two must go together.

In accordance with the conditioning of desire, fear, disgust, and so forth--
the conditioning of habitual tendencies that one has been accustomed to since
beginningless time--mind itself appears as body, enjoyments, abode, and so
forth.  Yet, childish ordinary individuals do not comprehend that these
[appearances] are the identity of their own minds.  Conceiving of mind as being
"here" and objects "over there," they hold the separation, the vast divide
between the apprehended and apprehender, to be established in actuality.  This
is entirely imputation, or a deluded misapprehension of the way things are, as
when not knowing that the dream elephant is personal experience, but instead
apprehending it as an actual elephant in the external world.

Instead of prompting the appearance of delusions and/or hallucinations,
many of the patients receiving Valium displayed a progressive development
of dislikes and hates.  The patients themselves deliberately used the term
"hate".  This hatefulness first involved non-significant figures in the
patients' environment, progressed from there to the involvement of key
figures such as aides, nurses and physicians, and went on to the involvement
of important personal figures such as parents and spouses...  This
hatefulness was of a peculiar type.  The patients were unhappy with it; they
realized that it was unnatural and without basis, but were impotent to do
anything about it. Many of them, exhibiting real distress, would inquire,
"Why do I feel like this?"

You might find this discussion of attitudes threatening or insulting.  No one
wants to be told they're practicing incorrectly.  We don't want to hear that
we are uptight or repressed, that we are unskillful in dealing with our pain.
We just want to continue doing what we are doing.  But there's a Tibetan saying
that the highest teaching is the one that reveals practice and any mistake you
might be making, it will only result in what you most truly desire--progress in
your spiritual development.  Remember, I know of these mistakes because I've
made them all myself.  Practice involves a radical transformation of our being,
and we have to learn to face and eventually to dissolve all the attitudes we
have about everything, not only meditation.  So check yourself out.

Generally speaking, whenever we perceive things, our perception is deluded, in
that we project onto things a status of existence and a mode of being which is
simply not there.  We exaggerate things, and the way they then appear falsely
to our minds gives rise to afflictive emotions.  When we see our friends or
enemies, for instance, we superimpose on them a quality of desirability or
undesirability that is beyond the actual facts of the situation, and this
superimposition or exaggeration sparks off fluctuating states of emotion in
our mind.  Towards our friends we feel strong attachment and desire, and
towards our enemies powerful anger and hatred.  So if we are serious about
trying to purify our minds of these afflictive emotions, an understanding of
emptiness becomes crucial.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, in "Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great
     Perfection", Snow Lion Publications
~
If you examine the nature of your own mind, you will realize that the
pollutants, such as afflictive emotions and thoughts rooted in a distorted
way of relating to the world, are actually unstable.  No matter how powerful
an affliction, when you cultivate the antidote of true insight into the nature
of reality, it will vanish because of the power of the antidote, which
undermines its continuity.  However, there is nothing that can undermine the
basic mind itself; nothing that can actually interrupt the continuity of
consciousness.  The existence of the world of subjective experience and
consciousness is a natural fact.  There is consciousness.  There is mind.
There is no force that can bring about a cessation of your mental continuum.
  -- His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, in "Illuminating the Path to
     Enlightenment", published by Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive

When we habituate our minds to being fearless, to being brave and open towards
our emotions, fearlessness will also arise naturally.  In order for this to
happen we must train in applying antidotes to our thought patterns that are
caught up in fear.  In this way, we transcend fear first through a conceptual
process, which later becomes nonconceptual, a natural fearlessness.  In order
to become fearless in this way, we need determination and the willingness to
face our emotions.  With that strong determination and courage, fearlessness
will arise effortlessly.

But again, I warn you my son: If you want to continue to be a devoted yogi,
generally you should never cling to dreams.  If you do, you will eventually
expose yourself to the influence of the four maras.  If your dreams are
positive, do not have any expectations.  If we are filled with hopes and
expectations, even positive things can turn negative.  If your dreams are
negative, don't take them too seriously.  Learn to see negative dreams as
illusion, not real.  Then, although a dream seems negative, because we realize
that it isn't real, it becomes a positive thing that prepares us for further
development and realization in the spiritual path.  This is the practice of
a yogi.

In our time it is broadly true that political writing is bad writing.  Where
it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of
 rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a "party line."  Orthodoxy,
of whatever color, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style.  The political
dialects to be found in pamphlets, leading articles, manifestos, White Papers
and the speeches of under-secretaries do, of course, vary from party to party,
but they are all alike in that one almost never finds in them a fresh, vivid,
home-made turn of speech.  When one watches some tired hack on the platform
mechanically repeating the familiar phrases--bestial atrocities, iron heel,
bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder--
one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being
but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments
when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns them into blank
discs which seem to have no eyes behind them.  And this is not altogether
fanciful.  A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance
towards turning himself into a machine.  The appropriate noises are coming out
of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were
choosing his words for himself.  If the speech he is making is one that he
is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of
what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church.  And
this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate
favorable to political conformity.

One of the most important practices is that of tolerance, patience.  Tolerance
can be learned only from an enemy; it cannot be learned from your guru.  At
these lectures, for instance, you cannot learn tolerance, except perhaps when
you are bored!  However, when you meet your enemy who is really going to hurt
you, then, at that moment you can learn tolerance.  Shantideva makes a
beautiful argument; he says that one's enemy is actually a good spiritual
guide because in dependence upon an enemy one can cultivate patience, and in
dependence upon patience one accumulates great power of merit.  Therefore, it
is as if an enemy were purposefully getting angry in order to help you
accumulate merit.

In the intermediate stages of practice, you must be like a farmer during the

conditions which are so valuable to our practice, should use them
immediately, understanding that there is no time to be wasted.

Inner development comes step by step.  You may think "Today my inner calmness,
my mental peace is very small," but still, if you compare, if you look five,
ten, or fifteen years back, and think, "What was my way of thinking then?  How
much inner peace did I have then and what is it today?", comparing it with what
it was then, you can realize that there is some progress, there is some value.
This is how you should compare--not with today's feeling and yesterday's
feeling, or last week or last month, even not last year, but five years ago.
Then you can realize what improvement has occurred internally.  Progress comes
by maintaining constant effort in daily practice.

It is important for us to have a stable and peaceful mind, for it is mostly
through our mind that we experience suffering and problems.  With diligence,
we can establish our minds in peace by abandoning the afflictions that create
obstacles.  Meditation makes this possible because it establishes a steady
mind.  Among the many types of meditation, calm abiding (shamatha) and deep
insight (vipashyana) are central to this process.  In calm abiding, our mind
is focused inwardly, which allows us to suppress the afflictions so that they
do not actually manifest.  There is a sense of distance between us and the
afflictions.  It is not possible, however, to eradicate them with calm abiding
alone; deep insight is necessary to remove them at the root.

    If you persevere in this practice of recognizing the state of natural
light, it will progressively become easier to repeat the lucid recognition
that you are dreaming.  There will arise a steady awareness within the dream,
and you will know that you are dreaming.  When you look in a mirror, you see
a reflection.  Regardless of whether it is beautiful or ugly, you know that
it is a reflection.  This is similar to knowing that a dream is a dream, to
being lucid.  Whether the dream is tragic or ecstatic, you are aware that it
is merely a dream.
    Awareness within the Dream State becomes a way to develop oneself and to
break one's heavy conditioning.  With this awareness, one can manipulate the
dream material.  For example, one can dream whatever one wishes, or one can
pick up a desired theme.  One can continue dreaming from where one left off
on a previous occasion.

There are two kinds of food--food for mental hunger and food for physical
hunger.  Thus a combination of these two--material progress and spiritual
development is the most practical thing.  I think that many Americans,
particularly young Americans, realize that material progress alone is not
the full answer for human life.  Right now all of the Eastern nations are
trying to copy Western technology.  We Easterners such as Tibetans, like
myself, look to Western technology feeling that once we develop material
progress, our people can reach some sort of permanent happiness.  But when
I come to Europe or North America, I see that underneath the beautiful
surface there is still unhappiness, mental unrest, and restlessness.  This
shows that material progress alone is not the full answer for human beings.

The eighth root downfall is to regard our physical bodies, or the skandhas or
aggregates of our psycho-physical makeup, as impure and base.  The reason why
this is a root downfall is because Vajrayana sees everything as sacred.  All
appearances is a form of divinity, all sound is the sound of mantra, and all
thought and awareness is the divine play of the transcending awareness, the
Mahamudra experience.  The potential for that sacredness exists within our
present framework, so to speak, of the five skandhas.  Acknowledging psycho-
physical aggregates of an individual as the potential of the Buddhas of the
five families, or the five elements, or the five feminine aspects, and so
forth, is to recognize that, in tantra, the potential for the transformation
exists within our present situation.  To disparage that potential as something
useless or impure or unwholesome is a root downfall, a basic contradiction,
from the point of view of tantric practice.

  Insofar as the destructive effects of anger and hateful thoughts are

Theoretically it may be comfortable to have compassion for "all sentient
beings," but through our practice we realize that "all sentient beings" is
a collection of individuals.  When we actually try to generate compassion
for each and every individual, it becomes much more challenging.  But if we
cannot work with one individual, then how can we work with all sentient
beings?  Therefore it is important for us to reflect more practically, to
work with compassion for individuals and then extend that compassion further.

There are two appropriate methods of mahamudra meditation to give rise to
the primordial awareness of the dharmadhatu: looking while the mind is
resting and looking while the mind is moving.  The approach to the first
method is the meditation of calm abiding.  One lets one's mind rest until
it abides calmly, and then with precision one looks at it.  One looks for
how it rests, for where it abides, and whoever or whatever it is that
abides there.  This is looking at the true nature of the mind while the
mind is resting.

What is the purpose of the Dharma?  Just like other spiritual traditions,
Buddhadharma is an instrument for training the mind--something we use to try
to work out the problems that we all experience; problems that originate
mainly at the mental level.  Negative emotional forces create mental unrest,
such as unhappiness, fear, doubt, frustration and so forth; these negative
mental states then cause us to engage in negative activities, which in turn
bring us more problems and more suffering.  Practicing Dharma is a way of
working out these problems, be they long-term or immediate.  In other words,
Dharma protects us from unwanted suffering.

  For a romantic relationship to survive, more than romantic love is needed.
We need to love the other person as a human being and as a friend.  The sexual
attraction that feeds romantic love is an insufficient basis on which to
establish a long-term relationship.  Deeper care and affection, as well as
responsibility and trust, must be cultivated.
  In addition, we do not fully understand ourselves and are a mystery to
ourselves.  Needless to say, other people are even more of a mystery to us.
Therefore, we should never presuppose, with a bored attitude that craves
excitement, that we know everything about our partner because we have been
together so long.  If we have the awareness of the other person being a
mystery, we will continue to pay attention and be interested in him or her.
Such interest is one key to a long-lasting relationship.

The Perfection of Zeal
    1. Thus, one who has patience should cultivate zeal, because Awakening is
established with zeal, and there is no merit without zeal, just as there is no
movement without wind.
    2. What is zeal?  It is enthusiasm for virtue.  What is said to be its
antithesis?  It is spiritual sloth, clinging to the reprehensible, apathy, and
self-contempt.
    3. Spiritual sloth arises from indolence, indulging in pleasures, sleep,
and craving for lounging around due to one's apathy toward the miseries of the
cycle of existence.
    4. Scented out by the hunters, the mental afflictions, you have entered the
snare of rebirth.  Why do you not recognize even now that you are in the mouth
of death?

Sufferings arise from specific causes and conditions, which are collected by
individual sentient beings.  That being so, it is extremely important that
individual sentient beings know what is to be practiced and what is to be
given up--what brings suffering and what brings long-lasting happiness.  We
must show sentient beings the right path, which brings happiness and the wrong
path, which brings suffering.  Therefore, when we talk about benefiting other
sentient beings, it is through showing them the path and helping them
understand what is to be given up and what is to be practiced.  This is how
we can help other sentient beings.

We make our lives miserable by being miserable, so why not do exactly the
opposite, and make our lives happy, joyful, and harmonious, by being happy,
joyful, and harmonious?  We create our own lives and yet we think that
something else is doing it.  All we have to do is change our mental
reactions towards the opposite direction.  And the way to do that is to
meditate, otherwise we won't have the strength of mind to do it.  A mind
that can meditate is a mind that is one-pointed.  And a mind that is one-
pointed, the Buddha said, is like an ax that has been sharpened.  It has a
sharp edge that can cut through everything.  If we want to remove stress
and strain, and have a different quality of life, we have every opportunity.
We need to strengthen our mind to the point where it will not suffer from
the things which exist in the world.

Now in our day-to-day lives we know that the more stable, calm and contented
our mind is, the more feelings and experiences of happiness we will derive
from it.  The more undisciplined, untrained, and negative our mind is, the
more we suffer mentally, and physically as well.  So we can see only too well
that a disciplined and contented mind is the source of our happiness.

If we do not wish merely to know intellectually about the view of emptiness,
but rather wish to experience it ourselves in our own continuum, we should
build a firm foundation for this.  Then, according to our mental ability we
should hear and consider both the sutras and treatises which teach the profound
view of emptiness as well as the good explanations of them by the experienced
Tibetan scholars in their commentaries.  Together with this, we should learn
to make our own ways of generating experience of emptiness accord with the
precepts of an experienced wise man.

A great deal of our suffering comes from having too many thoughts.  And, at
the same time, the way we think is not sane.  We are only concerned by our
immediate satisfaction and forget to measure its long-term advantages and
disadvantages, either for ourselves or for others.  But such an attitude
always goes against us in the end.  There is no doubt that by changing our
way of seeing things we could reduce our current difficulties and avoid
creating new ones.

practice does counteract the afflictions then even if it is not beautiful,

It is very important to understand the context of the Buddhist emphasis on
recognizing that we are all in a state of suffering, otherwise there is a
danger we could misunderstand the Buddhist outlook, and think that it involves
rather morbid thinking, a basic pessimism and almost an obsessiveness about the
reality of suffering.  The reason why Buddha laid so much emphasis on
developing insight into the nature of suffering is because there is an
alternative--there is a way out, it is actually possible to free oneself from
it.  This is why it is so crucial to realize the nature of suffering, because
the stronger and deeper your insight into suffering is, the stronger your
aspiration to gain freedom from it becomes.  So the Buddhist emphasis on the
nature of suffering should be seen within this wider perspective, where there
is an appreciation of the possibility of complete freedom from suffering.  If
we had no concept of liberation, then to spend so much time reflecting on
suffering would be utterly pointless.

Lack of understanding of the true nature of happiness, it seems to me, is the
principal reason why people inflict sufferings on others.  They think either
that the other's pain may somehow be a cause of happiness for themselves or
that their own happiness is more important, regardless of what pain it may
cause.  But this is shortsighted, no one truly benefits from causing harm to
another sentient being.  Whatever immediate advantage is gained at the expense
of someone else is short-lived.  In the long run causing others misery and
infringing their rights to peace and happiness result in anxiety, fear and
suspicion within one-self.  Such feelings undermine the peace of mind and
contentment which are the marks of happiness.

When we're told that things are mere deceptive appearances, we shouldn't

terrified.  You wake up soaked in sweat and screaming.  What a relief!  It was
just a nightmare and none of it actually happened, but while it all seemed to

Everything on this planet functions according to the law of nature.  Particles
come together, and on the basis of their co-operation everything around us, our
whole environment, can develop and be sustained.  Our own body too has the same
structure.  Different cells come together and work together in co-operation,
and as a result, human life is sustained.  In a human community the same law
and principle of co-operation applies.  Even for an aeroplane to fly or for a
single machine to work, it can only do so by depending on many other factors,
and with their co-operation.  Without them it is impossible.  Just so, to
sustain everyday life in human society we need co-operation.

Purifying the unwholesome: In the past we have engaged in unwholesome physical,
verbal, and mental actions.  All these actions are of the past and cannot be
touched; we cannot reach back and wipe them away.  They have left detrimental
imprints on our mind-stream that obstruct our spiritual practice and manifest
as suffering when they come to full maturation, giving rise to misfortune and
grief.  However, these imprints can be affected, and even purified, by our
present behavior.  They are like seeds carried along in the current of our
mind-stream.  We cannot annihilate them without a trace, but we can burn them
so that they have little or no potency to cause damaging results.

First it is important to recognize the human form as rare and precious.  It is
not enough just to obtain this precious human form which has great potential;
rather, you should use that potential to its fullest extent by taking its
essence.  For example, if a person's ascent to high office is not followed by
good work for the community and people, it is not very beneficial and
worthwhile.  If, on the basis of full use of the potential, one is able to
accomplish great feats, that would truly be a great success.  Therefore, it is
important initially to recognize all the significance and great potential of
this human existence.

Like yourself, everyone else from their own side equally does not want
suffering and equally wants happiness.  For example, among ten ill people,
each of them just wants happiness; from their side they are all ill, and
they all want to be freed from their illness.  Hence there is no possible
reason for making a biased exception, treating a certain one better and
neglecting the others.  It is impossible to select one out for better
treatment.  Moreover, from your own viewpoint, all sentient beings, in
terms of their connection with you over the course of lifetimes, have in
the past helped you and in the future will help again.  Thus, you also
cannot find any reason from your own side to treat some better and others
worse.

When we practice, initially, as a basis we control ourselves, stopping the
bad actions which hurt others as much as we can.  This is defensive.  After
that, when we develop certain qualifications, then as an active goal we
should help others.  In the first stage, sometimes we need isolation while
pursuing our own inner development; however, after you have some confidence,
some strength, you must remain with, contact, and serve society in any
field--health, education, politics, or whatever.

Other paths that are aimed at "sudden awakening" lead one on an unmapped
journey that may offer no clear indications of progress.  In contrast, in this
practice we have definite sign-posts along the way.  Look at your mental
distortions and see how they are doing.  After practicing for a month, a year,
six years, are the mental distortions somewhat diminished?  Do wholesome
qualities arise more readily, more frequently, more deeply?  At the very root
of the mental distortions, is the self-grasping attenuated?  Is there less
self-centeredness and greater humility?  Is there more loving concern for the
welfare of others?  All of these are causes that lead either to well-being or
to misery.

In the jungle of samsara arisings are ceaseless, there is never any let up in
the interplay between past, present and future and in the turbulent interchange
between inner thoughts and outer events.  'I', 'me' and 'mine' are tossed about
like corks in the waves.  There is no exit from this on the level of 'I'.
There is no way to think yourself out of samsara.  Even the thoughts that
everything is empty, or is Padmasambhava, or pure from the very beginning do
not help for no thought can unlock the door to awakening.  The key is not
shaped like a thing; it is not a thought, a feeling or a sensation.  It's not
something outer or inner.  The key is your own nature, how you have been from
the very beginning, simple, raw, naked, uncontrived, free of all constructs.

In ancient times, a candidate for initiation into the Mysteries was led through
a series of dark chambers, virtually a labyrinth, beset by terrifying sounds
and ominous presences.  And then in the adytum, the final chamber, there was a
sudden illumination.  The enthroned hierophant tells the candidate, "Behold the
light, my child! It is your own being and nature."  Just this epopteia, or
sudden illumination, is the introduction to the Clear Light that is one's own
original nature.  The course of the initiation in the ancient Mystery Religions
simulates the experience of death and rebirth and leads the candidate into what
lies beyond, so that one no longer need fear death.  This initiatory process
may be compared to the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

A memory is more atmospheric than accurate, more an evolving fiction than a

progress.  Still, we cling to philosophical railings, religious icons,
pillars of belief.  We forget on purpose that Earth is rolling at 1,000
miles an hour, and, at the same time, falling elliptically around our sun,
while the sun is swinging through the Milky Way, and the Milky Way migrating
along with countless other galaxies in a universe about 13.7 billion years
old.  An event is such a little piece of time and space, leaving only a
mindglow behind like the tail of a shooting star.  For lack of a better

Many people who approach the practice of Buddhism are willing to sacrifice one
or two hours of their day in order to perform some ritual practice or engage in
meditation.  Time is relatively easy to give up, even though their life may be
very busy.  But, they are not willing to change anything of their personality--
they are not willing to forgo anything of their negative character.  With this
type of approach to Buddhism, it hardly matters how much meditation we do, our
practice remains merely a hobby or a sport.  It does not touch our lives.  In
order actually to overcome our problems, we have to be willing to change--
namely to change our personality.  We need to renounce and rid ourselves of
those negative aspects of it that are causing us so much trouble.

The self that is grasped by ignorance should be refuted, but we should not
refute the conventionally existent self.  If we refute the self that is merely
conventionally existent, that is like a seeing a person and saying, "Oh, I
didn't see the person."  Or we might look at another person and say, "All I
see is the basis of designation of the person or the visual form of the body."
This is no way to speak. It would be impossible to maintain any valid or
justifiable use of language in this way.  We would be negating the existence
of a merely designated self, but we would not negate the self that is refuted
by means of the wisdom that investigates the nature of emptiness.  Once again,
the self to be negated is the self which is grasped by ignorance.

In general, the countries of the East have had less material progress and thus
have great suffering from poverty.  In the West, though poverty is not severe,
there is the suffering of worry and not knowing satisfaction.  In both East and
West, many persons spend their lives in jealousy and competition; some think
only of money, and when they meet with conditions unfavourable to their wish
develop a dislike or enmity for these unfavourable circumstances from the very
orb of their heart.  Within and between countries people are disturbed, not
trusting and believing each other, having to spend their lives in continual
lies and deceit.  Since the most we can live is a hundred years, what point is
there in spending our lives in jealousy, deceit, and competition?

Mere belief in a source of refuge is not firm; unless there is valid cognition,
you are going only on the assertion that Buddhism is good.  Refuge is not an

and what scriptures are not.  In order for the mind to engage one-pointedly in
practice, there must be reasoned conviction that only the Buddhist path is
non-mistaken and capable of leading to the state of complete freedom from
defects and possession of all auspicious attainments. One should engage in
honest investigation, avoiding desire and hatred and seeking the teaching that
sets forth the means for fulfilling the aims of trainees.

  The teeth, hair and nails are not I, nor am I bone, blood, mucus, phlegm,

  Flesh is not I, nor are the sinews, warmth nor air.  The bodily cavities are
not I, nor is any one of the six types of consciousness.
  If the self truly exists in the manner in which it appears, then it should be
identifiable as one inspects the components of a person one by one.  Following
the above verses, no part of the body, including the four elements and space,
nor the six types of consciousness can be identified as the self.  This implies
that the self that experiences joy and sorrow and that appears to the mind as
if it existed independently does not exist at all.  This is ascertained by
engaging in such analysis.

  Once, on behalf of his mother, Kyogom produced a thangka of the five buddha
families.  He asked the guru, Gampopa, to bless it quickly.
  Gampopa agreed, saying, "Burn this stick of incense and make a mandala
offering."
  He then transformed himself into the Buddha, and from his ushnisha there
radiated a glorious light that dissolved into the thangka.  The air resounded
with the tinkling of bells and the drumbeat of the damaru, and the sky was
filled with parasols, auspicious banners, and canopies.  The sound of cymbals
was heard, and a rain of flowers fell from the sky.
  When Kyogom saw this, the lama said, "This is the way to do a rapid
consecration."

supreme knowledge that realizes how things actually are, it is impossible to
see ultimate reality.  On the other hand, if we have the correct view of
understanding identitylessness but no meditative concentration in which the
mind rests one-pointedly, our mind will be distracted by other objects, not be
under control, and thus not be workable.  Consequently, it will be impossible
for the light of wisdom to shine clearly and realize ultimate reality.  Another
analogy for the need to combine calm abiding and superior insight as an
inseparable unity is a sharp scalpel in the steady hand of an experienced
surgeon.  If the scalpel is blunt or the surgeon's hand shaky, the operation
cannot be performed properly.  In the same way, when the mind rests in a state
that involves both stillness and a crisp wakefulness or awareness, it is like
a steady hand that deftly operates on our objects of investigation with the
sharp blade of superior insight.

... when a candidate for public office faces the voters he does not face men
of sense; he faces a mob of men whose chief distinguishing mark is the fact
that they are quite incapable of weighing ideas, or even of comprehending
any save the most elemental--men whose whole thinking is done in terms of
emotion, and whose dominant emotion is dread of what they cannot understand.
So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost.

... all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and
mediocre--the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is
a virtual vacuum.

The Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men.  As democracy is
perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of
the people.  We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the

Flight's greatest gift is to let us look around.  I mean a simple form of
looking around, and one that requires little instruction--just gazing down at
the ordinary scenery sliding by below.  The best views are views of familiar
things, like cities and farms and bottlenecked freeways.  So set aside the
beauty of sunsets, the majesty of mountains, the imprint of winds on golden
prairies.  The world beneath our wings has become a human artifact, our most
spontaneous and complex creation.  Tourists may not like to contemplate the
evidence, with its hints of greed and self-destruction, but the fact remains
that the old sterilized landscapes--like designated outlooks and pretty parks
and sculpted gardens--have become obsolete, and that it is largely the airplane
that has made them so.  The aerial view is something entirely new.  We need to
admit that it flattens the world and mutes it in a rush of air and engines, and
that it suppresses beauty.  But it also strips the facades from our
constructions, and by raising us above the constraints of the treeline and the
highway it imposes a brutal honesty on our perceptions.  It lets us see
ourselves in context, as creatures struggling through life on the face of a
planet, not separate from nature, but its most expressive agents.  It lets us
see that our struggles form patterns on the land, that these patterns repeat to
an extent which before we had not known, and that there is a sense to them.

Although we regard the realization of the selflessness of persons as something
particularly exalted and therefore difficult to achieve, in fact, if you look
directly at your mind and see its nature, you will realize this selflessness.
This is not a matter of trying to convince yourself that there is no self in
the mind.  It is simply a matter of looking.  And when you look, you will see
that there is no mind, and that therefore there is no self that could be
imputed on the basis of the mind.

Material progress is for the sake of achieving that happiness and relieving
that suffering which depends upon the body.  But it is indeed difficult to
remove all suffering by these external means and thereby achieve complete
satisfaction.  Hence there comes to be a great difference between seeking
happiness in dependence upon external things and seeking it in dependence
upon one's own internal spiritual development.  Furthermore, even if the
basic suffering is the same, there is a great difference in the way we
experience it and in the mental discomfort that it creates, depending upon
our attitude towards it.  Hence our mental attitude is very important in
how we spend our lives.

  If you have love, deities and humans will love you and will naturally
gravitate toward you.  Moreover, the Conqueror defeated Mara's armies with the
power of love, so love is the supreme protector, and so forth.  Thus, although
love is difficult to develop, you must strive to do so.
  The way to cultivate love is as follows.  Just as you can develop compassion
once you have repeatedly thought about how living beings are made miserable by
suffering, develop love by thinking repeatedly about how living beings lack all
happiness, both contaminated and uncontaminated.  When you become familiar with
this, you will naturally wish for beings to be happy.  In addition, bring to
mind various forms of happiness and then offer them to living beings.

Karma has four main characteristics.  The first is its increasing effect:
goodness heralds further goodness and evil heralds further evil.  Secondly,
karma is definite: in the long run, goodness always produces joy and negativity
always produces suffering.  Thirdly, one never experiences a joy or sorrow that
does not have an according karmic cause.  And lastly, the karmic seeds that are
placed on the mind at the time of an action will never lose their potency even
in a hundred million lifetimes, but will lie dormant within the mind until one
day the conditions that activate them appear.

The ideal of calm exists in a sitting cat.  -- Jules Reynard

  There are generally two kinds of buddhist meditation: stabilizing meditation
and analytical meditation.  The stabilizing type of meditation gets the brain
very mellow.  It is a soothing of the mind to a clear state of calm, like a
still lake.  Stabilization allows all thoughts to flow through the mind without
attachment to any of them.  But the analytical type of meditation uses the
power of logic to examine what is bothering one.  Through meditative analysis,
problems are conquered by finding their root causes and by developing
techniques for mitigating the effects of those causes on the mind.  Analysis
can focus on topics such as impermanence, suffering, the need for patience,
and other topics.
  These two phases of meditation are not practiced at different times of the
day, but from instant to instant.  At first, when one is a beginner, one must
actively work to stabilize the mind and release all the distractions.  But
just when one starts to doze off because this process is so relaxing, one
switches over to analytical meditation to keep the brain moving and to balance
out the bliss.
  One has to pay careful attention to the state of one's mind to determine
what is needed at a particular time.  But this wakeful refocusing of the
attention helps to develop mindfulness, which in turn helps develop
understanding and concentration.  Later on, the switch between analytical
and stabilizing meditations will happen somewhat more automatically; if
thoughts start swirling too fast, the meditative mind seeks stabilization.  If
things get too calm or placid, then analysis can bring the balance back to
thinking and improving.
  Analysis is insufficient by itself, because it might be all about what's
currently "wrong" or it might produce a billion approaches to improving the
mind which cannot all be followed, but it would miss out on just enjoying our
somewhat short existence.  Complete realization of the enjoyability of
sentience and sapience seems to come from stabilization, not analysis.  And
stabilization is not enough by itself either, because one sees the result
of too much placidity in a person asleep in bed: they have a cow-like calm
without any thoughts breaking the surface to cause future progress.  The
impetus behind the push towards enlightenment seems to come from analysis,
because one cannot see why one would want to fully awake and aware unless
one can logically compare that state with the current one.  Thus analytical
and stabilizing meditations are the dynamic duo of meditation, the laurel
and the hardy, the R and the D, the anion and the cation, for without both
the ultimate mental state is unattainable.

I know that many people have difficulty thinking of spirits in the way I
describe them.  There are many spirits described in Tibetan texts related to
specific places in Tibet.  I'm not sure, if we live in New York or Tokyo, that
it's very helpful to try to connect to those spirits.  When we are in Western
cities, rather than thinking of spirits living in mountain passes or caves, we
might find it easier to think that spirits travel the streets, creating anger
and agitation in the drivers.  When we experience aggressive driving, it is a
good idea to breathe evenly and relax.  Otherwise, we may find ourselves
connected to traffic demons!

In Tantra the term bodhicitta assumes a more specific connotation.  The essence
of enlightenment or "Buddha-nature," revealed in the sutras of the third
turning of the wheel of Dharma, is equated to the subtle essence (thig le) of
the human body, the coarse aspect of which is present in the seminal fluid and
in the ovum.  Thus in Tantra, bodhicitta is recognized as the seed of the
manifestation of the infinite mandalas and deities who are all already
contained in potentiality in the energy structure of the physical body itself,
what is known as the "vajra body."  However in spite of this underlying
recognition as its base, tantric practice entails visualization and commitments
of body voice, and mind to achieve the transformation of the energies of impure
vision into the pure dimension of the mandala and of the deities.

I always explain that violence is not the human way.  I believe that,

satisfaction, negative side effects are also incurred.  Then, most importantly,
whether we like it or not, we have to live side by side with the Chinese; thus,
in the long future, generation to generation, in order to live happily,
peacefully, it is extremely important, while we are carrying on the struggle,
to accord with the principle of non-violence.

Mencken's Creed

  I believe that religion, generally speaking, has been a curse to mankind--
that its modest and greatly overestimated services on the ethical side have
been more than overcome by the damage it has done to clear and honest thinking.
  I believe that no discovery of fact, however trivial, can be wholly useless
to the race, and that no trumpeting of falsehood, however virtuous in intent,
can be anything but vicious.
  I believe that all government is evil, in that all government must
necessarily make war upon liberty...
  I believe that the evidence for immortality is no better than the evidence
of witches, and deserves no more respect.
  I believe in the complete freedom of thought and speech...
  I believe in the capacity of man to conquer his world, and to find out what
it is made of, and how it is run.
  I believe in the reality of progress.
  I--But the whole thing, after all, may be put very simply.  I believe that it
is better to tell the truth than to lie.  I believe that it is better to be
free than to be a slave.  And I believe that it is better to know than be
ignorant.

the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds

  When we talk about patience or tolerance, we should understand that there are
many degrees, starting from a simple tolerance, such as being able to bear a
certain amount of heat and cold, progressing toward the highest level of
patience, which is the type of patience and tolerance found in the great
practitioners, the Bodhisattvas on the high levels of the Buddhist path.
Since patience or tolerance comes from a certain ability to remain firm and
steadfast, to not be overwhelmed by the adverse situations or conditions that
one faces, one should not see tolerance or patience as a sign of weakness, but
rather as a sign of strength coming from a deep ability to remain steadfast and
firm.  We can generally define patience or tolerance in these terms.  We find
that even in being able to tolerate a certain degree of physical hardship, like
a hot or cold climate, our attitude makes a big difference.
  If we have the realization that tolerating immediate hardship can have long-
term beneficial consequences, we are more likely to be able to tolerate
everyday hardships.  Similarly, in the case of those on the Bodhisattva levels
of the path practicing high levels of tolerance and patience, intelligence also
plays a very important role as a complementary factor.

Completely pure desirous attachment expresses itself through Buddha Amitabha.
A person guided by desire, attachment, or grasping becomes diffused and loses
power over phenomena.  Through completely purified desirous attachment,
however, one is able to gain control over, and to independently coordinate,
everything.  This is because the entourage, possessions, merit, and so forth
are controlled by the power of this Buddha.  In this way Amitabha grants us the
empowering enlightened activity and the empowering extraordinary achievements.

The third aspect of the practice of generosity is giving the gift of the
Dharma by making the teachings available.  Through the Dharma, we can bring
understanding into the lives of others and help them remove their patterns of
ignorance.  We do not have to be great scholars to practice generosity through
the Dharma.  We may know just one line of the Dharma, but if we know that one
line clearly and correctly, we can genuinely express it to others and help
them.  If we know four lines of the teachings, through those four lines we can
help to clear up someone's ignorance or lessen someone's problems and
sufferings.  What counts is not how much we know but how correctly we know it
and how sincerely we use it to help others.  We should not wear the mask of the
Dharma, pretending we know a great deal and are doing great things, while
hiding ugliness inside us.

One difference between the destructive, negative emotions on the one side and
constructive, positive emotions on the other is that constructive, positive
emotions have a strong grounding in valid experience and reasoning.  In fact,
the more we analyze these positive emotions, the more they are enhanced.
Negative, afflictive emotions, by contrast, are usually quite superficial.
They have no grounding in reason and often arise out of habit rather than
reasoned thought processes.

Whenever you travel on an airplane, the flight attendants demonstrate what to
do in an emergency.  They tell you to put the oxygen mask over your own nose
before putting it over your child's nose.  That's not because you should be
selfish, but because if you pass out, you won't be able to help anyone at all.
So you see, the essential point is that we must first subdue our own minds
before we can effectively serve others.

If you have failed to subdue your own mind, even if a thousand Buddhas surround
you, they will be of no benefit.  If you want to subdue your enemies, you must
subdue your own mind.  If you want to bring about world peace, subdue your
mind.  A subdued mind is the Lama.  A subdued mind is the Dakini, the chosen
deity, and the Buddha.  A subdued mind is the pure land.  You are already
imbued with the Buddha-nature.  This is your inherent nature.  What actual
benefit have you gotten from the essential nature of your mind?

Subject: Free minix-like kernel sources for 386-AT

Do you pine for the nice days of minix-1.1, when men were men and wrote
their own device drivers? Are you without a nice project and just dying
to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you
finding it frustrating when everything works on minix? No more all-
nighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post might be just
for you :-)

As I mentioned a month(?) ago, I'm working on a free version of a
minix-lookalike for AT-386 computers. It has finally reached the stage
where it's even usable (though may not be depending on what you want),
and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution. It is
just version 0.02 (+1 (very small) patch already), but I've successfully
run bash/gcc/gnu-make/gnu-sed/compress etc under it.

Sources for this pet project of mine can be found at nic.funet.fi
(128.214.6.100) in the directory /pub/OS/Linux. The directory also
contains some README-file and a couple of binaries to work under linux
(bash, update and gcc, what more can you ask for :-). Full kernel
source is provided, as no minix code has been used. Library sources are
only partially free, so that cannot be distributed currently. The
system is able to compile "as-is" and has been known to work. Heh.
Sources to the binaries (bash and gcc) can be found at the same place in
/pub/gnu.

ALERT! WARNING! NOTE! These sources still need minix-386 to be compiled

(and gcc-1.40, possibly 1.37.1, haven't tested), and you need minix to
set it up if you want to run it, so it is not yet a standalone system
for those of you without minix. I'm working on it. You also need to be
something of a hacker to set it up (?), so for those hoping for an
alternative to minix-386, please ignore me. It is currently meant for
hackers interested in operating systems and 386's with access to minix.

The system needs an AT-compatible harddisk (IDE is fine) and EGA/VGA. If
you are still interested, please ftp the README/RELNOTES, and/or mail me
for additional info.

I can (well, almost) hear you asking yourselves "why?". Hurd will be
out in a year (or two, or next month, who knows), and I've already got
minix. This is a program for hackers by a hacker. I've enjouyed doing
it, and somebody might enjoy looking at it and even modifying it for
their own needs. It is still small enough to understand, use and
modify, and I'm looking forward to any comments you might have.

I'm also interested in hearing from anybody who has written any of the
utilities/library functions for minix. If your efforts are freely
distributable (under copyright or even public domain), I'd like to hear
from you, so I can add them to the system. I'm using Earl Chews estdio
right now (thanks for a nice and working system Earl), and similar works
will be very wellcome. Your (C)'s will of course be left intact. Drop me
a line if you are willing to let me use your code.

Question: How do things exist if they are empty of inherent existence?

His Holiness: The doctrines of emptiness and selflessness do not imply the non-
existence of things.  Things do exist.  When we say that all phenomena are void
of self-existence, it does not mean that we are advocating non-existence, that
we are repudiating that things exist.  Then what is it we are negating?  We are
negating, or denying, that anything exists from its own side without depending
on other things.  Hence, it is because things depend for their existence upon
other causes and conditions that they are said to lack independent self-
existence.

When you engage in a project or an activity that helps other sentient beings,
there is no question of a time limit.  You must do it continuously.  This is
how you should train your mind.  If you think you will achieve enlightenment or
bodhichitta within a few days or months, and if you think that you will get
enlightened after entering into a retreat for three years and three months, you
are mistaken.  When I hear the suggestion that you will attain Buddhahood if
you go into retreat for three years and three months, sometimes I jokingly say
that this is just like communist propaganda.  I tell my Western friends that
wanting to practice the most profound and the quickest path is a clear sign
that you will achieve no result.  How can you achieve the most profound and the
vast in the shortest way?  The story of the Buddha says that he achieved
Buddhahood after three countless aeons.  So harboring an expectation to achieve
Buddhahood within a short time-like three years and three months-is a clear
indication that you will make no real progress.  We have to be practical.
There is no use in fooling others with your incomplete knowledge.

Buddhist moral philosophy is strikingly pragmatic.  Something is valuable
insofar as it is relevant to people's lives and useful for achieving their
happiness.  If it will bring happiness for oneself and others, pursue it; if it
will bring suffering, better to avoid it.  There are no absolute dictates;
ethical personal behavior is seen as simply the most practical way to cope with
the difficulties of the human condition.  Although guidelines and copious
illustrations are given, nothing is absolute or definitive.  The power and
freedom to make decisions rests with the individual.  There is no arbitrary or
mysterious force controlling our lives; there is simply the law of cause and
effect.  Of course, decisions are dependent upon many factors.  The choices we
make are conditioned by circumstances, both outer and inner, but ultimately
human beings have free will to decide.  Individuals make decisions and
experience the consequences of their decisions.

Chemistry stands at the pivot of science. On the one hand it deals with biology
and provides explanations for the processes of life.  On the other hand it
mingles with physics and finds explanations for chemical phenomena in the
fundamental processes and particles of the universe.  Chemistry links the
familiar with the fundamental.

  From a Buddhist point of view, one might be able to distinguish different
states of dreaming.  Generally speaking, a dream is a dream, something you
can't control.  But for the highly advanced meditator, there could be
possibilities for gaining certain insights through dreams.
  I know some Tibetans who lived in Tibet prior to the 1959 uprising.  Before
their escape from Tibet, they did not know about the natural trails and passes
by which to get over the Himalayas into India.  Some of these people I met had
very clear dreams of these tracks and, years later, when they actually had to
follow the actual trails, they found that they were already familiar with them
because of the very clear dreams they had had previously.

  One method for disciples to develop bodhichitta entails recognizing all
beings as having been their mothers in some previous life and focusing on
their mothers' kindness.  Similarly, guru-meditation requires focusing on
their mentors' kindness.
  Many Westerners, however, have difficulty focusing on the kindness of their
mothers.  Unable to find the goodness and kindness in their mothers, most
cannot find any goodness in themselves either.  Although they may be desperate
for love and kindness, their mental blocks often prevent them from recognizing
and appreciating the kindness of others, for instance their spiritual mentors.
No matter how much kindness they receive, it is never enough.
  One of the reasons for being unable to acknowledge our mothers' kindness
may be that they fail to live up to our models of ideal parents.  Similarly,
when our spiritual mentors have shortcomings and do not live up to our models
of ideal teachers, we may also have difficulty recognizing their kindness.
Like children yearning for ideal love, we feel cheated if our mentors fail
to meet our expectations.

The word dharma in Sanskrit means "that which holds".  All existents are
dharmas, phenomena, in the sense that they hold or bear their own entity or
character.  Also, a religion is a dharma in the sense that it holds persons
back or protects them from disasters.  Here the term dharma refers to the
latter definition.  In rough terms, any elevated action of body, speech or
mind is regarded as a dharma because through doing such an action one is
protected or held back from all sorts of disasters.  Practice of such
actions is practice of dharma.

What is my purpose in life, what is my responsibility?  Whether I like it or
not, I am on this planet, and it is far better to do something for humanity.
So you see that compassion is the seed or basis.  If we take care to foster
compassion, we will see that it brings the other good human qualities.  The
topic of compassion is not at all religious business; it is very important to
know that it is human business, that it is a question of human survival, that
is not a question of human luxury.  I might say that religion is a kind of
luxury.  If you have religion, that is good.  But it is clear that even without
religion we can manage.  However, without these basic human qualities we cannot
survive.  It is a question of our own peace and mental stability.

  We often get angry when something we consider undesirable happens.  But what
use is this anger?  If we can change the situation, then let's go ahead and do
it.  There's no need to be angry.  It's very useful to think like this when
confronted with social problems and injustice.  They can be changed, so rather
than be angry, it's wiser to work calmly to improve the society.
  On the other hand, if the situation can't be changed, anger is equally
useless.  Once our leg is broken, we can't unbreak it.  All of the corruption
in the world can't be solved in a year.  Getting angry at something we can't
alter makes us miserable.  Worrying about or fearing something that hasn't
happened immobilizes us.  Shantideva said in A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way
of Life:
    Why be unhappy about something If it can be remedied?  And what is the
    use of being unhappy about something If it cannot be remedied?

From the Hacker's Lexicon:

Heisenbug  /hi:'zen-buhg/ from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle in
quantum physics  n. A bug that disappears or alters its behavior when one
attempts to probe or isolate it.  Antonym of Bohr bug; see also mandelbug,
schroedinbug.  In C, nine out of ten heisenbugs result from either
fandango on core phenomena (esp. lossage related to corruption of the
malloc arena) or errors that smash the stack.

Schroedinbug  MIT: from the Schroedinger's Cat thought-experiment in
quantum physics  n. A design or implementation bug in a program which
doesn't manifest until someone reading source or using the program in an
unusual way notices that it never should have worked, at which point the
program promptly stops working for everybody until fixed.  Though this
sounds impossible, it happens; some programs have harbored latent
schroedinbugs for years.  Compare heisenbug, Bohr bug, mandelbug.

Bohr bug  /bohr buhg/ from quantum physics  n. A repeatable bug; one that
manifests reliably under a possibly unknown but well-defined set of
conditions.  Antonym of heisenbug; see also mandelbug, schroedinbug.

Mandelbug  /mon'del-buhg/ from the Mandelbrot set  n. A bug whose
underlying causes are so complex and obscure as to make its behavior
appear chaotic or even non-deterministic.  This term implies that the
speaker thinks it is a Bohr bug, rather than a heisenbug.  See also
schroedinbug.

The essence of dharma practice is to bring about a discipline within the mind,
a state of mind free of hatred, lust and harmful intentions.  Hence the entire
message of the buddhadharma could be summed up in two succinct statements:
"Help others," and "If you cannot help them, at least do not harm others."
It is a grave error to think that apart from such a disciplining of the
physical and mental faculties there is something else called "the practice of
dharma."  Various, and in some cases divergent, methods to achieve such an
inner discipline have been taught in the scriptures by the Buddha.

As progress is made in dream practice, dreams become clearer and more detailed,
and a larger part of each dream is remembered.  This is a result of bringing
greater awareness into the dream state.  Beyond this increased awareness in
ordinary dreams is a second kind of dream called the dream of clarity, which
arises when the mind and the prana are balanced and the dreamer has developed
the capacity to remain in non-personal presence. Unlike the samsaric dream, in
which the mind is swept here and there by karmic prana, in the dream of clarity
the dreamer is stable.  Though images and information arise, they are based
less on personal karmic traces and instead present knowledge available directly
from consciousness below the level of the conventional self.

The path to genuine co-operation is again through sincere compassion and love.
Sometimes we misunderstand compassion as being nothing more than a feeling of
pity.  Compassion is much, much more.  It embraces not only a feeling of
closeness, but also a sense of responsibility.  When you develop compassion, it
will help you enormously to generate inner strength and self-confidence, and to
reduce your feelings of fear and insecurity.  So compassion and love, embodied
in an attitude of altruism, are qualities that are of tremendous importance for
the individual, as well as for society and the community at large.

The value of transmission is not only that of introducing the state of
knowledge, but lies also in its function of bringing about the maturing of the
transmission, right up until one reaches realization.  For this reason the
relationship that links master and disciple is a very close one.  The master,
in Dzogchen, is not just like a friend who helps and collaborates with the
disciple; rather the master is himself or herself the path.  This is because
the practice of contemplation develops through the unification of the state of
the disciple with that of the master.  The master is extremely important, too,
at the Sutra and the Tantra levels of teaching, in the former because he or she
is the holder of Buddha's teachings, and in the latter because he or she is the
source of all the manifestations of transformation.

Setting the Appropriate Motivation
    It is very important before receiving any Dharma teaching to set a proper
motivation, or reaffirm and enhance that motivation if we already basically
have it.  This is important not only for those who are listening to a spiritual
discourse, but also for the person delivering it.  If a discourse or
explanation is given with an attitude of pride, competitiveness or jealousy, it
will not do as a Dharma teaching.  A Buddhist teaching must be given with the
sincere wish to benefit all beings by means of it.
    Likewise, the listeners to a Buddhist teaching must have a proper
motivation, always thinking, "What new point can I learn from this that will
help me be of more benefit to others?"  If we sit here with the notion to learn
something about mahamudra so that we can make a display of ourselves and
proudly talk to others about mahamudra so that they will consider us an
erudite, spiritual person, we have a completely wrong motivation.

The Tibetan word that is usually translated as "blessing" or "inspiration" can
more literally be translated as "to transform into magnificence."  We are
asking the Buddhas to transform our minds into magnificence.  How that happens
isn't by the Buddha going in and pulling some switches inside our mind.
Because our mind is conditioned and changing, the mental energy of the Buddha's
realizations can affect our energy, so to speak.  Conditioned phenomena affect
each other, so the force of Tara's realizations can positively affect our mind.

Whether or not we actually achieve the realisation of bodhicitta and to what
level or depth we gain such a realisation depends upon the force of our
experience of great compassion.  This great compassion, which aspires to free
all sentient beings from suffering, is not confined to the level of mere
aspiration.  It has a dimension of far greater power, which is the sense of
commitment or responsibility to personally bring about this objective of
fulfilling others' welfare.  In order to cultivate this powerful great
compassion, we need to train our mind separately in two other factors.  One is
to cultivate a sense of empathy with or closeness to all sentient beings, for
whose sake we wish to work so that they become free from suffering.  The other
factor is to cultivate a deeper insight into the nature of the suffering from
which we wish others to be relieved.

Hamlet's Cat's Soliloquy

To go outside, and there perchance to stay
Or to remain within: that is the question:
Whether 'tis better for a cat to suffer
The cuffs and buffets of inclement weather
That Nature rains on those who roam abroad,
Or take a nap upon a scrap of carpet,
And so by dozing melt the solid hours
That clog the clock's bright gears with sullen time
And stall the dinner bell.
To sit, to stare Outdoors, and by a stare to seem to state
A wish to venture forth without delay,
Then when the portal's opened up, to stand
As if transfixed by doubt.
To prowl; to sleep;
To choose not knowing when we may once more
Our readmittance gain: aye, there's the hairball;
For if a paw were shaped to turn a knob,
Or work a lock or slip a window-catch,
And going out and coming in were made
As simple as the breaking of a bowl,
What cat would bear the household's petty plagues,
The cook's well-practiced kicks, the butler's broom,
The infant's careless pokes, the tickled ears,
The trampled tail, and all the daily shocks
That fur is heir to, when, of his own free will,
He might his exodus or entrance make
With a mere mitten?
Who would spaniels fear,
Or strays trespassing from a neighbor's yard,
But that the dread of our unheeded cries
And scratches at a barricaded door
No claw can open up, dispels our nerve
And makes us rather bear our humans' faults
Than run away to unguessed miseries?
Thus caution doth make house cats of us all;
And thus the bristling hair of resolution
Is softened up with the pale brush of thought,
And since our choices hinge on weighty things,
We pause upon the threshold of decision.

It is not good to begin many different works, saying "This looks good; that

REFUGE
What kind of refuge does Buddhism offer?  How are Buddhists and non-Buddhists
differentiated?  From the viewpoint of refuge, a Buddhist is someone who
accepts Buddha, his doctrine, and the spiritual community as the final refuge.
From the viewpoint of philosophy, a Buddhist is someone who asserts the four
views that guarantee a doctrine as being Buddhist.  With respect to the three
refuges, called the Three Jewels, it is said that the Buddha is the teacher of
refuge but that the actual refuge is the Dharma, the doctrine.  Buddha himself
said, "I teach the path of liberation.  Liberation itself depends upon you."
From the same perspective, Buddha said, "You are your own master."  The
spiritual community are those who assist one in achieving refuge.

Bodhisattvas are motivated by universal compassion, and they seek the ultimate
goal of buddhahood in order to be of service to others.  They embark on this
path with the generation of the mind of enlightenment, which Geshe Rabten
states is "the wish for Supreme Enlightenment for the sake of others.  The sign
of the true Bodhicitta is the constant readiness to undergo any sacrifice for
the happines of all beings."  Unlike ordinary beings, who think of their own
advantage, bodhisattvas consider how best to benefit others.

Why are there fierce protectors?  Peaceful deities such as Tara have a certain
energy that calms and gladdens our mind.  But sometimes our mind is so
belligerent and stuck that we need the kind of energy that goes "Pow!" to wake
us up or to pull us out of unproductive behavior.  For this reason, the
Buddhas' wisdom and compassion appear in the form of these wrathful deities to
demonstrate clean-clear wisdom and compassion that act directly.  This active
wisdom doesn't vacillate and pamper us.  This wisdom doesn't say, "Well,
maybe," or, "Poor you.  You deserve to be treated well, not like that horrible
person treated you."  Instead, it's forceful: "Cut it out!  Stop those false
expectations and preconceptions right now!"  Sometimes we need that strong,
wise energy to be in our face to wake us up to the fact that our afflictions
and old patterns of thought and behavior are making us miserable.

The human essence of good sense finds no room with anger.  Anger, jealousy,
impatience, and hatred are the real troublemakers; with them problems cannot
be solved.  Though one may have temporary success, ultimately one's hatred or
anger will create further difficulties.  With anger, all actions are swift.
When we face problems with compassion, sincerely and with good motivation, it
may take longer, but ultimately the solution is better, for there is far less
chance of creating a new problem through the temporary "solution" of the
present one.

Killing and eating meat are interrelated, so do we have to give up eating
animal products?  I myself once tried to give it up, but health problems arose
and two years later my doctors advised me to again use meat in my diet.  If
there are people who can give up eating meat, we can only rejoice in their
noble efforts.  In any case, at least we should try to lessen our intake of
meat and not eat it anywhere where it is in scarce supply and our consumption
of it would cause added slaughter.

The mind is beyond expression, thought and conceptualization, because it is
empty.  Yet, there is phenomena and appearance.  The objects that you cling to
in this waking reality are dreamlike, but if you do not inquire into the nature
of this dream, you remain attracted as though there were really something here.
Upon examination, you find that these objects have no true existence at all and
are just like space.  A practitioner who understands that phenomena lack
inherent existence and resemble space should then examine himself or herself to
discover whether he or she possesses an individual self.  Then it will be
discovered that there is no truly existing examiner either.

In discursive meditations it is imperative that one's growing disenchantment
with mundane existence is complemented with growing confidence in the real
possibility of true freedom and lasting joy that transcends the vicissitudes
of conditioned existence.  Without this faith and the yearning for such
liberation, the meditations may easily result in profound depression, in which
everything seems hollow, unreal, and futile.  Thus instead of polarizing one's
desires towards the single-pointed pursuit of nirvana, one is reduced to a
debilitating kind of spiritual sloth.

I believe that in human actions, the prime mover is motivation.  On the spot,
it is important to tackle the symptoms of problems, but in the long run, it is
necessary to look at the motivation and whether there is possibility to change
it.  For the long run, this is crucial.  As long as the negative motivation is
not changed, then although there might be certain rules and methods to stop
counterproductive actions, human beings have the ability through various ways
to express their negative feeling.  Thus, for the long run, we need to look at
our motivation and try to change it.  This means that we must try to cultivate
the right kind of motivation and try to reduce the negative motivation.

When we talk of karma or action, it entails action committed by an agent, in
this case, oneself, in the past.  So what type of future will come about, to a
large extent, lies within one's own hands and can be determined by the kind of
initiatives that one takes now.  Not only that, but karma should not be
understood in terms of passive, static kind of force, but rather in terms of
active process.  This indicates that there is an important role for the
individual agent to play in determining the course of the karmic process.
Consider, for instance, a simple act like fulfilling our need for food.  In
order to achieve that simple goal one must take action on one's own behalf: one
needs to look for food, to prepare it, to eat it.  This shows that even a
simple act, even a simple goal is achieved through action.

  Nothing is easier than to bring others down to our level, particularly in
cultures where it is taken as a sign of keen intelligence to view every person
and situation as a challenge to "name the ten things wrong with this picture."
The presence of Guru Rinpoche in so many forms in our world makes us question
life in a way pre-1959 persons rarely had to.  Life isn't the same after
meeting the Dalai Lama or Kyentse Rinpoche and others.  We can't erase them
from our minds, as inconvenient as these open doors to enlightenment might be.
We had other plans; we didn't ask to see so vividly another totally different
horizon.
  The question, "How can I integrate this into my daily life?" doesn't plumb
the depth of the inquiry.  I have translated for lamas in North America,
Europe, and Asia, and have found this to be the typical North American
question.  I think the best answer is, "You can't; don't even try."  But I
have to wonder about the question itself.  What do you do when an event or an
encounter changes your life?  If you won a 10,000,000 dollar jackpot, if a
dear friend dies, or if you fall deeply in love, do you ask, "How can I
integrate this into my daily life?"  Some events change us, are earth-
shattering, and are not meant to be integrated into what can sometimes feel
like a rat race existence.  Meeting Guru Rinpoche is one such event.

Now in terms of the actual practice, when one is immersed in the contemplation
of the clear light, since all dualistic appearances vanish, it becomes
impossible to distinguish the object from the consciousness perceiving it.

Guardians of the teachings
  There are eight principal classes of Guardians each with many subdivisions.
Some are highly realized beings, others not realized at all.  Every place--
every continent, country, city, mountain, river, lake or forest--has its
particular dominant energy, or Guardian, as have every year, hour and even
minute: these are not highly evolved energies.  The various teachings all have
energies which have special relationships with them: these are more realized
Guardians.  These energies are iconographically portrayed as they were
perceived when they manifested to masters who had contact with them, and their
awesome power is represented by their terrifyingly ferocious forms, their many
arms and heads, and their ornaments of the charnel ground.  As with all the
figures in tantric iconography, it is not correct to interpret the figures of
the guardians as merely symbolic, as some Western writers have been tempted to
do.  Though the iconographic forms have been shaped by the perceptions and
culture of those who saw the original manifestation and by the development of
tradition, actual beings are represented.

5. When others out of jealousy treat me unreasonably, with abuse, slander, and
so on, I will learn to take all loss and offer the victory to them.  When any
type of deserved or undeserved slander, prompted by jealousy, and so forth,
and unpleasant verbal abuse [comes to one], do not lose patience.  Keep a
peaceful mind.  Further, when problems arise, do not say "It is his fault,
not mine!"  Accept the blame, as did Geshe Lang ri thang pa. [Reflect:]
  "Whoever created this mess, it includes me!  I have [a hand in it] also."
The reason for this is that we must endeavor toward generosity and the various
modes of ethical behavior, for the sake of purifying our many misdeeds and
completing the accumulations [of merit and wisdom].
  Therefore, when one shows kindness to slanderers, even if one does not
deserve the abuse and slander, it is said to be necessary for purifying our
misdeeds when problems arise.  Taking all blame on ourselves prevents our evil
karma from arising.
  Geshe Lang ri thang pa speaks of a person from the Valley of Phan who
sometimes gave a little butter cake to the Lamas, and at other times slandered
them for no reason.  The Lamas regarded him with great kindness.  This
cleansed their misdeeds and helped their accumulation of the two collections.
They claimed that his slanderous talk was great. Shantideva's
bodhisattvacaryavatara says:
    Therefore, since patience can be generated
    In dependence upon a very hate filled mind
    And because it is the cause of patience,
    Make offerings to it as if it was the most excellent doctrine!
More correct even than this statement is that ethics and patience lead to
great merit, and to the end of misdeeds such as anger.  Therefore it is said
that the hardest practice is patience.  [Learn] the patience that is keeping
still no matter what happens.

All sentient beings are exactly the same in that every one desires happiness
and seeks to avoid misery.  We are not isolated entities disconnected from
each other.  The happiness and suffering of other beings affect us.  This
mutual relation is obvious.  Sentient beings have been kind and have benefited
us directly and indirectly throughout beginningless time.  These beings are
intrinsically the same as us in their pursuit of happiness and effort to avoid
suffering.  Thus, it is essentially logical for us to train in cultivating an
impartial attitude wishing for the happiness of all beings.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, "Stages of Meditation", Snow Lion Pub.
~
  Our exaggerated sense of self and our compulsion to find happiness for this
larger-than-life self we have fabricated cause us to ignore, neglect and harm
others.  Of course, it is our right to love and take care of ourselves, but
not at the expense of others.  While "As long as I'm alright" is our motto,
we have no hesitation in acting with total disregard for others.
  We may find this description of self-concern altogether too crass to apply
to us.  "I'm not like that," we object, but though we may not consciously
think in this way, when self-concern is operating, our behavior shows a cold
indifference to others.  Conflicts between partners, parents and children and
with other family members, conflicts between students and teachers and on a
larger scale within and between countries have their source in personal and
collective self-concern.
  Buddhas and Bodhisattvas see clearly that our neglect of others, our self-
preoccupation and our disregard for the connection between actions and their
effects are responsible for all our miseries.

  Ordinarily, it is difficult to remember one's past life.  Such recollections
seem to be more vivid when the child is very young, such as two or three, and
in some cases even younger.  ...When the present body is fully formed, the
ability to recall past life seems to diminish.
  The mental associations with this life become increasingly dominant.  There
is a close relationship during the first few years of one's life with the
continuum of consciousness from the previous life.  But as experiences of this
life become more developed and elaborate, they dominate.
  It is also possible within this lifetime to enhance the power of the mind,
enabling one to reaccess memories from previous lives.  Such recollection
tends to be more accessible during meditative experiences in the dream state.
Once one has accessed memories of previous lives in the dream state, one
gradually recalls them in the waking state.

Relaxation involves a kind of awareness which reverses the normal tendency
that we have.  Because, as we have seen, this ordinary sense of self that we
have lacks inherent self existence, it has to keep constructing itself and
that requires a particular kind of effort.  The ego's root feeling is that if
I do not hold myself together there will be a falling apart into something
chaotic and difficult.  So there is anxiety, an energetic anxiety which is
located in the body, in the whole energetic system of the body and
interpersonal turbulence reminds us again and again "If I don't keep it
together, I will get in trouble."  The belief in reincarnation indicates that
for many lifetimes we have been caught up in this anxiety, this nervous
contraction which is holding our ordinary grasping sense of self in place.

Buddhas are always striving for the welfare of beings migrating in cyclic
existence.  In every hour and minute they create limitless forms of welfare
for beings throughout billions of emanations of their body, speech and mind.
For instance, in this aeon--an aeon being a period of an extremely great
number of years--they will appear in the aspect of one thousand supreme
Emanation Bodies (Nirmanakaya) as Buddhas, and each will have his own new
teaching.

Spiritual Mentors
  The Buddhist teachings differentiate between flash insights (nyam, nyams),
and stable realizations (togpa, rtogs-pa).  A flash insight does not make a
significant change in one's life, but may lead in that direction.  A stable
realization, on the other hand, whether it be partial or complete, actually
produces a noticeable improvement that lasts.  The distinction we are drawing
here between Dharma instructors and spiritual mentors derives from this
difference.  Dharma instructors may have either insight or realization,
whereas spiritual mentors need to have some level of stable realization.

When we practice, initially, as a basis we control ourselves, stopping the bad
actions which hurt others as much as we can.  This is defensive.  After that,
when we develop certain qualifications, then as an active goal we should help
others.  In the first stage, sometimes we need isolation while pursuing our
own inner development; however, after you have some confidence, some strength,
you must remain with, contact, and serve society in any field--health,
education, politics, or whatever.

There are people who call themselves religious-minded, trying to show this by
dressing in a peculiar manner, maintaining a peculiar way of life, and
isolating themselves from the rest of society.  That is wrong.  A scripture of
mind-purification (mind-training) says, "Transform your inner viewpoint, but
leave your external appearance as it is."  This is important.  Because the
very purpose of practicing the Great Vehicle is service for others, you should
not isolate yourselves from society.  In order to serve, in order to help, you
must remain in society.

  The indivisible nature of mind is said to possess a "mobile quality."  This
mobile quality is described as currents of energy which flow through the
channels of various parts of the body, presiding over physical as well as
mental functions, and pass through the nostrils as breathing.  Such currents
of energy, called "winds" (rlung, vayu), serve as the bridge between body and
mind.
  The winds are a blend of two types of energy, one associated with
emotionality, called karmic or conditioned wind (las kyi rlung), and the other
related to the original state of the individual, called pristine awareness
wind (ye shes kyi rlung).  Distinguished in terms of the three principles,
darkness (tamas), mobility (rajas), and buoyancy (sattva), winds are of three
types: wind of Rahu, solar wind, and lunar wind.  Moreover, the winds are
differentiated as the five root winds (rtsa ba'i rlung), the natures of the
five elements, and five branch winds (yan lag gi rlung), produced through the
five elemental transformations.  The winds of the five elements, or five
mandalas, flow back and forth through the right and left nostrils in the order
of generation of the elements and of birth (first space, then wind, fire,
water, earth) and in the order of dissolution of the elements and of death
(first earth, then water, and so on), respectively.  In one day, they are
exhaled and inhaled 21,600 times, divided between the two nostrils, a time
corresponding to eight periods or watches (thun).  The outward movement of
these energy currents as the breath diminishes the strength of the wind
associated with pristine awareness.  Therefore, when outward movement
increases, there occur signs of death.  If the winds are held inside,
pristine awareness wind is strengthened.  Hence, many extraordinary powers
such as longevity are gained through breath control techniques for "holding
the winds" in the central channel.

  ...you should have the deep conviction that cessation of the sufferings and
the delusions is possible, and also that it is possible within your mind.
True cessation is a state where you have destroyed the delusions at their root
so that there remains no potential for their re-emergence.  Such a cessation
can be realized only through the true paths that penetrate into the nature of
reality.
  When you develop this conviction, you will also be able to develop faith in
a being who has really mastered cessation, who is the Buddha--a person who has
fully accomplished the realization of the dharma.  If you contemplate along
such lines, you will be able to develop a very deep faith and conviction in
Buddha Shakyamuni and see him as an incomparable master.
  What distinguishes Buddhist practitioners from others is the factor of
taking refuge.  But merely seeking a refuge out of the fear of suffering is
not unique to Buddhists; non-Buddhists could also have such a motivation.  The
unique practice of refuge that Buddhists should have is that of taking refuge
in the Buddha out of a deep conviction in his exceptional qualities and
realizations.  If you think in such terms you will be able to understand Lama
Tsongkhapa's profound praise of Buddha Shakyamuni: "Those who are far from his
doctrine always reinforce the illusion of self-existence that they have within
themselves, whereas those who follow his guidance will be able to free
themselves from such confusions."

  ...they say that the initial realization of the nature of the mind is the
first breakthrough.  It's a very important point in all Buddhist schools.  At
that moment, you cease to be an ordinary person.  You become in Buddhist
parlance an arya, a noble one.  It doesn't mean you are finished.  It doesn't
mean you are a high level bodhisattva.  We can fall back from this.  But
still, this is a big breakthrough.  We now understand what is true and what is
not true.  We don't have to take it all on faith any more.  It is a direct
non-dual experience.  The point is that it is very easy.  It's not difficult,
and it's not something that can only be attained after years and years of
practice.
  Our main obstacle is the fact that we don't know how to relax our minds
enough to be open to this experience.  In the back of our minds we keep
thinking this is something so difficult and so advanced.  For this reason we
don't recognize what is in front of our face.  This is why a teacher can be
extraordinarily helpful.  A teacher living within that realization is able--
if the mind of the disciple is completely open--to transmit his or her
experience.  The problem here is that we have too many hopes and fears; it
creates a barrier.  It is very hard to be open.  You can't just will it.

The Level of Initial Capacity

All the essential spiritual practices related primarily to the achievement of
rebirth in the higher realms belong to what Atisha calls the 'small capacity'.

Verse 3
  Know that those who by whatever means
  Seek for themselves no more
  Than the pleasures of cyclic existence
  Are persons of the least capacity.
    [Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]

...the principal means for attaining birth in the higher realms is the ethical
discipline of refraining from the ten negative actions of body, speech and
mind.  These comprise three actions of the body--killing, stealing and sexual
misconduct; four verbal actions--lying, divisive speech, harsh speech and
frivolous speech; and three mental actions--covetousness, ill-will and
harbouring wrong views.  To live an ethically sound life, it helps to remind
ourselves of what are known as the four reflections, namely the preciousness
of human life; the inevitability of our death and the uncertainty of the time
of death; the infallibility of the law of cause and effect and the workings of
karma; and understanding the nature of suffering.  Concerning the first
reflection, some Tibetan masters have said that when we contemplate the
preciousness of this human existence, we should literally cultivate the
determination to make our human life something precious in itself, rather than
allowing it to be wasted or to become a cause of future suffering.

Contemplating these four reflections gives us the courage to engage earnestly
in the practice of the Dharma in order to free ourselves from the possibility
of rebirth in the lower realms.  This involves a process of training our mind,
not just at the mental level but also at the level of our emotions and
actions.  Living an ethical life is not a case of adhering to a set of
regulations imposed on us from outside, such as the laws of a country.  Rather
it involves voluntarily embracing a discipline on the basis of a clear
recognition of its value.  In essence, living a true ethical life is living a
life of self-discipline.  When the Buddha said that 'we are our own master, we
are our own enemy', he was telling us that our destiny lies in our own hands.

In his autobiography Freedom in Exile, His Holiness the Dalai Lama speaks of
his attachment as a child to the monastery's Master of the Kitchen,
commenting, "I sometimes think that the act of bringing food is one of the
basic roots of all relationships."  And the connection between giving food and
understanding the interrelationship of all life is recognized also in stories
about the belated discovery of an enlightened master who lived humbly as a
monastery cook; or the stories of a great lama who gathers his disciples to
test their progress, only to discover that the most highly realized of all is
the cook, who has neither meditated nor studied, but who simply served the
others.
    May you have long life,
    may the house be filled with grain,

The Level of Middling Capacity

In the following verse Atisha describes the characteristics of spiritual
trainees of the middling capacity.

Verse 4
  Those who seek peace for themselves alone,
  Turning away from worldly pleasures
  And avoiding destructive actions
  Are said to be of middling capacity.
    -- Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment

The phrase "destructive actions" refers to the afflictions that, together with
karma, constitute the origin of suffering.  This is why practitioners at the
level of middling capacity concentrate on the spiritual practices that are
primarily aimed at the elimination of the afflictions.  Broadly speaking,
these practices fall into two categories.  One is training the mind to
cultivate the genuine desire to gain freedom from cyclic existence, which is
often referred to as the cultivation of renunciation.  The other is
cultivating the path to bring about the fulfillment of that wish for
renunciation.  In order to train one's mind in this way, one needs to reflect
upon the defects of cyclic existence and to develop an understanding of the
causation chain of karma and the afflictions.  Through these reflections one
cultivates the wish to gain freedom and then embarks upon the path to bring
about that freedom.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, in "Lighting the Way", Snow Lion Publications
~
Number of Recitations
  The sixth section of the yoga of speech concerns measuring the accumulation
of mantra recitations.  How do you know when you have recited enough of a
particular mantra?  Generally speaking, you should count a mantra until you
achieve some common spiritual power and ideally until you achieve the supreme
spiritual attainment.  Wouldn't that be the best way?
  After all, if you are really hungry, don't you eat until you are satisfied?
Similarly, if you plan a trip to San Francisco, you want to travel until you
arrive at your destination.  You would not travel halfway and be satisfied
with that, would you?  In the same way, when you recite a mantra, you have a
specific goal in mind: to gain the supreme spiritual attainment--buddhahood.
Wouldn't it be wise to keep on reciting the mantra until you have achieved
your goal, or at least until you achieve some perceptible improvement?
  -- Gyatrul Rinpoche, in "The Generation Stage in Buddhist Tantra", published
     by Snow Lion Publications
~
The Level of Great Capacity

Atisha continues his discussion on the three capacities by turning his
attention to spiritual trainees at the highest level.

Verse 5
  Those who, through their personal suffering,
  Truly want to end completely
  All the suffering of others
  Are persons of supreme capacity.
    -- Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment

Practitioners at this level use their deep understanding of the nature of
suffering, derived from reflection on their personal experience, to recognise
the fundamental equality of oneself and others insofar as the desire to
overcome suffering is concerned.  This then leads to the arising of a
spontaneous wish to free all sentient beings from their suffering, a wish
which becomes the powerful impetus for engaging in spiritual practices aimed
at bringing about this altruistic objective.

The most important practice in relation to this altruistic goal is the
generation of bodhicitta, the altruistic aspiration to attain buddhahood for
the benefit of all beings.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, in Lighting the Way, Snow Lion Publications
~
The Meaning of Empowerment
  As for empowerment in general, what does the term wang, or empowerment,
signify?  To begin with, our fundamental nature--what we term "the buddha
nature", or tathagatagarbha, the very nature of our mind, is inherently
present within us as a natural attribute.  This mind of ours, the subject at
hand, has been going on throughout beginningless time, and so has the more
subtle nature of that mind.  On the basis of the continuity of that subtle
nature of our mind rests the capacity we have to attain enlightenment.  This
potential is what we call "the seed of buddhahood", "buddha nature", "the
fundamental nature", or tathagatagarbha.  We all have this buddha nature, each
and every one of us.  For example, this beautiful statue of Lord Buddha here,
in the presence of which we are now sitting, is a representation that honours
someone who attained buddhahood.  He awakened into that state of enlightenment
because his nature was the buddha nature.  Ours is as well, and just as the
Buddha attained enlightenment in the past, so in the future we can become
buddhas too.
  In any case, there dwells within us all this potential which allows us to
awaken into buddhahood and attain omniscience.  The empowerment process draws
that potential out, and allows it to express itself more fully.  When an
empowerment is conferred on you, it is the nature of your mind--the buddha
nature--that provides a basis upon which the empowerment can ripen you.
Through the empowerment, you are empowered into the essence of the buddhas of
the five families.  In particular, you are "ripened" within that particular
family through which it is your personal predisposition to attain buddhahood.
  So, with these auspicious circumstances established in your mindstream,
and when you reflect on what is taking place and maintain the various
visualizations, the conditions are right for the essence of the empowerment to
awaken within you, as a state of wisdom which is blissful yet empty--a very
special state that is the inseparability of basic space and awareness.  As you
focus your devotion in this way, it allows this special quality of mind, this
new capability, as it were, to awaken.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, in "Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great
     Perfection", published by Snow Lion Publications
~
Value Our Good Circumstances
  We often focus on a few circumstances in our life that aren't going well
instead of all those that are.  Although we all have problems, when we over-
emphasize their importance, we easily begin thinking that we are incapable and
worthless.  Such self-hatred immobilizes us and prevents us from developing
our good qualities and sharing them with others.
  When we look at the broad picture, however, we can see many positive things
in our life.  We can rejoice that we are alive and appreciate whatever degree
of good health we have.  We also have food (often too much!), shelter,
clothing, medicine, friends, relatives, and a myriad of good circumstances.
Many of the people reading this book live in peaceful places, not in war-torn
areas.  Many have jobs they like, and family and friends they appreciate.  We
shouldn't take these for granted.  Most importantly, from a spiritual
viewpoint, we have access to an authentic path, qualified teachers to guide
us, and kind companions who encourage us.  We have genuine spiritual
aspirations and the time to cultivate these.  Thinking about these good
conditions one by one, we will be filled with joy, and any sense of being
incapable and hopeless will vanish.

  This fresh state of present awareness (da lta'i shes pa)

  Do not hope or fear for good or bad outcomes.
  Regardless of what formulation of thought occurs,
    they arise and are liberated simultaneously;
  Their essential nature is empty awareness.

  Concern for others to be happy and compassion wishing them to be free from
suffering are needed not only as the basis for a bodhichitta motivation for
mahamudra* practice, but also for keeping that practice on course to its
intended goal.  When we have changed our focus in life from the contents of
our experience to the process of experience, there is great danger of becoming
fixated on mind itself.  This is because the direct experience of mind itself
is totally blissful--in a calm and serene sense--and entails extraordinary
clarity and starkness.  Concern for others is one of the strongest forces that
brings us back down to earth after having been up in the clouds.  Although all
appearances exist as a function of mind, other beings do not exist merely in
our head.  Their suffering is real and it hurts them just as much as ours
hurts us.
  Furthermore, to be concerned about someone does not mean to be frantically
worried about this person.  If we are fixated on our child's problems at
school, for example, we lose sight that whatever appearance of the problems
our mind gives rise to is a function of mind.  Believing the appearance to be
the solid reality "out there," we again feel hopeless to do anything and thus
become extremely anxious and tense.  We worry to the point of becoming sick
and we over-react toward our child, which does not help.  If we focus instead
on the process of mind that gives rise to our perception of the problem as if
it existed as some horrible monster "out there," we do not eliminate our
concern for our child, only our worry.  This allows us to take whatever clear
and calm action is necessary to alleviate the problem.  Thus not only is
compassion necessary for successful practice of mahamudra, but mahamudra
realization is necessary for successful practice of compassion.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, in "The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra",
     published by Snow Lion Publications
  * "Mahamudra" is a Sanskrit word meaning "great seal" and refers to the

45.  This fresh present knowing, unbound

This fresh present knowing,
Unbound by the intellect that clings to meditation,
Is naked unobstructed non-meditation.
Relax at ease
And settle in the state of naturalness.

When thoughts move, let them.
Movement arises and is liberated without a trace.
When there is no movement, don't search for it.
This is empty luminosity, naked empty awareness.
Tantric practice without suppression or

Brings the accomplishment of the destruction
  of hope and fear.

  ...karma refers not only to our actions but, more importantly, to the
motivation or intention behind them.  The acts themselves are not the primary
cause of our suffering; rather, it arises from the world of our intentions or,
in other words, from our thoughts and emotions.  These afflictive states of
mind underlie our negative karma and are therefore the source of our
suffering.

  Obviously, these afflictions won't go away simply by saying prayers or
wishing them away; they can only be eliminated by cultivating their
corresponding remedies or antidotes.  To understand how this process of
applying the antidote works we can observe our physical world.  For instance,
we can contrast heat and cold: if we are suffering from the effects of too
cold a temperature, then we increase the thermometer on our heater or air-
conditioning unit and adjust it to our comfort.  Thus, even in the physical
world we can see instances where opposing forces counter each other.

  ...From our own personal experience we recognise that anger and hostility
disturb our peace of mind and, more importantly, that they have the potential
to harm others.  Conversely, we recognise that positive emotions like
compassion and loving kindness can engender in us a deep sense of peace and
serenity, beneficial results that we can extend to others as well.  This
appreciation of their great value naturally leads to a desire to cultivate
these positive emotions.  It is through this gradual process that the
antidotes work in decreasing and eventually eliminating their opposing forces
in the mental realm, the realm of our thoughts and emotions.

Starting Dzogchen Practice
  When we start to practice, in order to grasp the normal mind, our first
practice consists in engaging our mind.  For example, if we have a problem of
some kind, we may go to a movie to distract ourselves from our problem.
Likewise when we start to practice, we try to calm down our problem-creating
mind in order to be able to observe the nature of thought.  The observation of
the arising, abiding, and dissolving of thought in the empty state of the mind
is an essential practice in Dzogchen in order to discover that moving thoughts
are of the same nature as the thoughtless state of the mind.  Since we are not
accustomed to meditation, it seems very difficult, and every slight sound or
movement, outside or inside the mind itself, becomes a major distraction
interfering with our ability to continue to practice.  In order to overcome
this problem, we engage the mind in a practice so that it is not so easily
distracted, by focusing attention so that the movement of the mind caused by
thought or sense perception does not have the power to divert our
concentration.  This first stage, of grasping the mind, is concentration
practice, described in detail in the Bonpo 'Ati' system.

Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic
religion for the future: it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and
theology; it covers both the natural & spiritual, and it is based on a
religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and
spiritual, as a meaningful unity

Techniques for Improvement
  All of us have attained a human life; we are, in a sense, incomparable among
the various types of sentient beings, as we are able to think about many
topics with a subtler mind and are endowed with vaster capabilities.  Dogs,
birds, and so forth do communicate, but only humans can settle and ascertain
deep topics on the basis of words; it is obvious that there are no other
sentient beings capable of as many thoughts and techniques.  Nowadays, humans
are engaging in many activities that were not even objects of thought a
century or two ago.  The metaphors of the poets of the past, such as "the
wonderful house of the moon", are becoming actualities.
  ...People have made great effort right up to this century, thinking to
become free from suffering, but we cannot point to even one person in the
world, no matter how rich he or she is, who has no worry--except for those
who have the inner happiness of renouncing the material way of life.  Without
internal renunciation it is difficult to achieve happiness and comfort.

While I was in Malaysia, I saw a T-shirt depicting a surfboard aloft huge
waves.  Sitting on the surfboard was a figure meditating cross-legged. The
slogan read, "Riding the waves of life, be mindful, be happy."  That's it.
Awareness.  Being present.  Knowing thoughts as thoughts, emotions as
emotions.  It's just like riding a surfboard. You gradually develop the
poise to cruise along on the roughest seas until, no longer immersed in
the waves, you are riding on top of them.  Of course you have to start
with small waves until you get your balance.  Then the higher the wave, the
better!  Likewise, when we begin to train in awareness, it is better if we
have an atmosphere which is nonthreatening and peaceful.  That's why people
go on retreat.  That's also a reason why people set aside regular sitting
periods.  But once we learn how to be balanced, we become like a surfer who
finds that the bigger the wave, the greater the fun.

The word "mantra" means "mind-protection".  It protects the mind from ordinary
appearances and conceptions.  "Mind" here refers to all six consciousnesses--
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mental consciousnesses--which are to be
freed, or protected, from the ordinary world.  There are two factors in mantra
training, pride in oneself as a deity and vivid appearance of that deity.
Divine pride protects one from the pride of being ordinary, and divine vivid
appearance protects one from ordinary appearances.  Whatever appears to the
senses is viewed as the sport of a deity; for instance, whatever forms are
seen are viewed as the emanations of a deity and whatever sounds are heard are
viewed as the mantras of a deity.  One is thereby protected from ordinary
appearances, and through this transformation of attitude, the pride of being a
deity emerges.  Such protection of mind together with its attendant pledges
and vows is called the practice of mantra.

Training in compassion has the capacity to be both profound and vast--both
absolute and relative.  Compassion has the quality of being approachable and
at the same time ungraspable.  It manifests both the quality of shunyata,
emptiness, or egolessness, as well as the qualities of kindness and joyfulness.
Therefore, from the Mahayana point of view, compassion is the most important
practice we could ever engage in.  It can lead us to the full realization of
enlightenment without any need for other practices.

Question: If the root of all suffering is attachment, are the desire to have a
family and the desire for liberation from suffering contradictory?

Answer: I think that a distinction should be made between desires that are due
to ignorance and desires that are reasoned.  In Tibetan, a difference can be
made between "wish" and "desire"; for instance a Bodhisattva is reborn through
his or her own wishes, not out of desire.  Similarly, it is suitable to aspire
toward liberation.  Also, persons, such as Foe Destroyers, who have completely
overcome all of the afflictive emotions, have thoughts such as, "Such and such
is good; I need it."  Merely such thoughts are not afflictive consciousnesses.
Similarly, if we consider the desire for a family, there are persons practicing
the Bodhisattva path who have families; also, in the scriptures of discipline,
Buddha himself set forth vows for lay persons and vows for monks.  Hence, there
is no general prohibition of the wish to have a family.

In general, most non-Buddhist religions meditate on the deity as being outside
the physical body.  In these cases the deity takes the form of a refuge, or of
a protector or messenger.  Thus do they meditate, and of course this is fine.
In the Buddhist tradition, however, the deity is not meditated on as being
outside of the physical body.  One meditates on the deity as being one's own
essence expressing itself through oneself arising as the deity.  One therefore
thinks, "I am the deity," and with this conviction one meditates.  Why is it
justifiable to meditate in this manner?  ...our own mind is in essence exactly
the same as the mind of a Buddha.  In the philosophical treatises this is
sometimes referred to as "sugatagarbha" or "buddha-nature".

  If things did in fact exist the way they appear--if things did exist so
concretely--then when one looked into and investigated them, this inherent
existence should become even clearer, more obvious.  However, when you seek
for the object designated, you cannot find it under analysis.
  ...[That] which gives rise to the appearance of I is mind and body, but when
you divide this into mind and body and look for the I, you cannot find it.
Also the whole, body, is designated in dependence upon the collection of parts
of the body; if you divide this into its parts and look for the body, you
cannot find it either.  Even the most subtle particles in the body have sides
and hence parts.  Were there something partless, it might be independent, but
there is nothing that is partless.  Rather, everything exists in dependence on
its parts...  There is no whole which is separate from its parts.
  ...No matter what the phenomenon is, internal or external, whether it be
one's own body or any other type of phenomenon, when we search to discover
what this phenomenon is that is designated, we cannot find anything that is it.
  ...However, these things appear to us as if they do exist objectively and in
their own right, and thus there is a difference between the way things appear
to our minds and the way they actually exist...  Since phenomena appear to us
in a way that is different from what we discover when analysing, this proves
that their concrete appearance is due to a fault of our minds.

The Buddhist notion of diligence is to delight in positive deeds.  Its
opposite, called "le lo" in Tibetan, has three aspects.  Le lo is usually
translated as "laziness," though only its first aspect refers to laziness as
we usually understand it.  The first aspect is not doing something because of
indolence, even though we know that it is good and ought to be done.  The
second aspect is faintheartedness.  This comes about when we underestimate our
qualities and abilities, thinking, "I'm so incompetent and weak.  It would be
good to do that, but I could never accomplish it."  Not having the confidence
of thinking, "I can do it," we end up doing nothing.  The third aspect refers
to being very busy and seeming diligent, but wasting time and energy on
meaningless activities that will not accomplish anything in the long run.
When we do many things for no real purpose, we fail to focus on what is truly
worthwhile and our path has no clear direction.  When we refrain from these
three aspects of laziness, we are diligent.

     Vehicles of Buddhism", edited and translated by Rosemarie Fuchs,

  All events and incidents in life are so intimately linked with the fate of
others that a single person on his or her own cannot even begin to act.  Many
ordinary human activities, both positive and negative, cannot even be
conceived of apart from the existence of other people.  Even the committing of
harmful actions depends on the existence of others.  Because of others, we
have the opportunity to earn money if that is what we desire in life.
Similarly, in reliance upon the existence of others it becomes possible for
the media to create fame or disrepute for someone.  On your own you cannot
create any fame or disrepute no matter how loud you might shout.  The closest
you can get is to create an echo of your own voice.
  Thus interdependence is a fundamental law of nature.  Not only higher forms
of life but also many of the smallest insects are social beings who, without
any religion, law, or education, survive by mutual cooperation based on an
innate recognition of their interconnectedness.  The most subtle level of
material phenomena is also governed by interdependence.  All phenomena, from
the planet we inhabit to the oceans, clouds, forests, and flowers that
surround us, arise in dependence upon subtle patterns of energy.  Without
their proper interaction, they dissolve and decay.

Going for Refuge to the Three Jewels
  ...a buddha is someone who has attained full enlightenment through the
cultivation of compassion and the wisdom of no-self, the absence of self-
existence.  From our discussion we also saw how the Dharma jewel is to be
understood as the path by which we can gradually accomplish the same result as
the fully awakened Buddha.  Likewise, the Sangha jewel is the community of
sincere practitioners who have directly realised emptiness, the ultimate
nature of reality.
  For those of us who consider ourselves to be practising Buddhists, it is
crucial to have this kind of deeper understanding of the Three Jewels when we
go for refuge to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

Being Mindful of Impermanence

  Loved ones who have long kept company will part.
  Wealth created with difficulty will be left behind.
  Consciousness, the guest, will leave the guest house of the body.
  Let go of this life--
  This is the practice of Bodhisattvas.

Although we have this human life with freedom and richness, which is so
valuable and difficult to get, it cannot last forever.  This is because it is
not permanent and is subject to decay moment by moment.  This life will
eventually become non-existent because our body and mind will separate.
Although death meditation involves reflecting on the moment by moment changing
nature of our life, it principally entails recognizing that one day it will
come to a complete stop and our mind will leave our body behind.  Therefore,
we must take the essence from this life each day and try to fulfill a great
Dharma purpose because we will not have this opportunity for long.

What do we mean when we speak of a truly compassionate kindness?  Compassion
is essentially concern for others' welfare--their happiness and their
suffering.  Others wish to avoid misery as much as we do.  So a compassionate
person feels concerned when others are miserable and develops a positive
intention to free them from it.  As ordinary beings, our feeling of closeness
to our friends and relatives is little more than an expression of clinging
desire.  It needs to be tempered, not enhanced.  It is important not to
confuse attachment and compassion....  A compassionate thought is motivated by
a wish to help release beings from their misery.

Tantric yogis succeed in their cultivation of wisdom more quickly than do
practitioners of the Perfection Vehicle because the tantric yogi, employing
deity yoga, can achieve a mind that is a union of calm abiding and special
insight--a mind of alert one-pointedness that realizes emptiness--in far
less time than the period of countless great aeons required for those who
practice sutra paths alone.  Tantric yogis use deity yoga to enhance
meditation on emptiness; their use of deity yoga brings them more quickly to
an initial direct cognition of emptiness by enhancing their ability to combine
meditative stability with analysis....  Also, in Highest Yoga Tantra,
powerful, subtle consciousnesses that realize emptiness are manifested,
whereby the obstructions to liberation and omniscience are quickly overcome.

Howard C. Cutler, MD:
  Is happiness a reasonable goal for most of us?  Is it really possible?

HH the Dalai Lama:
  Yes.  I believe that happiness can be achieved through training the mind.
When I say "training the mind," in this context I'm not referring to "mind"
merely as one's cognitive ability or intellect.  Rather, I'm using the term
in the sense of the Tibetan word Sem, which has a much broader meaning,
closer to "psyche" or "spirit"; it includes intellect and feeling, heart
and mind.  By bringing about a certain inner discipline, we can undergo a
transformation of our attitude, our entire outlook and approach to living.
  When we speak of this inner discipline, it can of course involve many things,
many methods.  But generally speaking, one begins by identifying those factors
which lead to happiness and those factors which lead to suffering.  Having
done this, one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead
to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness.  That is the way.

It can be difficult to accept others and to accept ourselves.  "I should be
better.  I should be something different.  I should have more."  All of this
is conception; it's all mental fabrication.  It's just the mind churning up
"shoulds," "ought tos," and "supposed tos."  All this is conceptual rubbish,
and yet we believe it.  Part of the solution is to recognize that these
thoughts are conceptual rubbish and not reality; this gives us the mental
space not to believe them.  When we stop believing them, it becomes much
easier to accept what we are at any given moment, knowing we will change in
the next moment.  We'll be able to accept what others are in one moment,
knowing that they will be different in the next moment.  This is good stuff
for everyday practice; it's very practical.

  The nature of samsaric evolution is not such that death is followed by
nothingness, nor that humans are always reborn as humans and insects as
insects.  On the contrary, we all carry within us the karmic potencies of all
realms of cyclic existence.  Many beings transmigrate from higher to lower
realms, others from lower to higher.  The selection of a place of rebirth is
not directly in our own hands but is conditioned by our karma and delusions.
They who possess spiritual understanding can control their destiny at the time
of death, but for ordinary beings the process is very much an automatic chain
reaction of karmic seeds and habitual psychic response patterns....
  Our repeated experience of frustration, dissatisfaction and misery does not
have external conditions as its root cause.  The problem is mainly our lack of
spiritual development.  As a result of this handicap, the mind is controlled
principally by afflicted emotions and illusions.  Attachment, aversion and
ignorance rather than a free spirit, love and wisdom are the guiding forces.
Recognizing this simple truth is the beginning of the spiritual path.

If persons who have attained calm abiding keep their minds in calm abiding,
not only does the force of their meditative stabilization remain but their
other good qualities increase and do not degenerate.  Similarly, persons who
have achieved special insight have clear perception not only with respect to
the object of observation on which they have been meditating but also with
respect to any other object to which they turn their minds.  Persons who
cultivate calm abiding but not special insight will gain the factor of
stability but not that of an intense clarity; they will not be able to
manifest any antidote to the afflictive emotions.  One must achieve an

  It is hypocrisy to say that all religions are the same.  Different religions
have different views and fundamental differences.  But it does not matter, as
all religions are meant to help in bringing about a better world with better
and happier human beings.  On this level, I think that through different
philosophical explanations and approaches, all religions have the same goal
and the same potential.  Take the concept[s] of the creator and self-creation
for instance.  There are big differences between the two, but I feel they have
the same purpose.  To some people, the concept of the creator is very powerful
in inspiring the development of self-discipline, becoming a good person with a
sense of love, forgiveness and devotion to the ultimate truth--the Creator or
God.
  The other concept is self-creation: if one wants to be good, then it is one's
own responsibility to be so.  Without one's own efforts one cannot expect
something good to come about.  One's future is entirely dependent on oneself:
it is self-created.  This concept is very powerful in encouraging an
individual to be a good and honest person.  So you see, the two are different
approaches but have the same goal.

  The wise perceive that all things--persons and phenomena--arise in reliance
upon their own causes and conditions, and that based on this process we impute
mental labels upon things.  The phenomena themselves have no true or inherent
existence from their own side.  They have no self-nature whatsoever.
  Were persons or phenomena to have a self-presence, there would be no need
for them to rely upon causes and conditions.  Therefore one can be certain
that even the smallest speck of matter has no true, inherent existence from
its own side.
  Although all things lack even the smallest speck of true existence,
nonetheless conventionally the laws of causes and conditions operate through
them, and conventionally all the phenomena in samsara and nirvana seem to
exist, arising in the same manner as do illusions, dreams and a reflected
image.

  And finally, new rule: America must recall the president.  That's what this
country needs.  A good old-fashioned, California-style, recall election!
Complete with Gary Coleman, porno actresses and action film stars.  And just
like Schwarzenegger's predecessor here in California, George Bush is now so
unpopular he must defend his job against...  Russell Crowe.  Because at this
point I want a leader who will throw a phone at somebody.  In fact, let's have
only phone throwers--Naomi Campbell can be the vice-president!

  Now I kid, but seriously Mr. President, this job can't be fun for you
anymore.  There's no more money to spend--you used up all of that.  You can't
start another war because you also used up the army.  And now, darn the luck,
the rest of your term has become the Bush family nightmare: helping poor
people.  Yeah, listen to your Mom.  The cupboard's bare, the credit card's
maxed out, and no one's speaking to you: mission accomplished.  Now it's time
to do what you've always done best: lose interest and walk away.  Like you did
with your military service.  And the oil company.  And the baseball team.
It's time.  Time to move on and try the next fantasy job.  How about cowboy
or space man?

  Now I know what you're saying; you're saying that there's so many other
things that you as President could involve yourself in...  Please don't.  I
know, I know.  There's a lot left to do.  There's a war with Venezuela... and
eliminating the sales tax on yachts.  Turning the space program over to the
church... and Social Security to Fannie Mae.  Giving embryos the vote.

  But, Sir, none of that is going to happen now.  Why?  Because you govern
like Billy Joel drives.  You've performed so poorly I'm surprised you haven't
given yourself a medal.  You're a catastrophe that walks like a man.  Herbert
Hoover was a shitty president, but even he never conceded an entire metropolis
to rising water and snakes.  On your watch, we've lost almost all of our
allies, the surplus, four airliners, two trade centers, a piece of the
Pentagon, and the City of New Orleans.  Maybe you're just not lucky!

  I'm not saying you don't love this country.  I'm just wondering how much
worse it could be if you were on the other side.  So, yes, God does speak to
you...  and what he is saying is: "Take a hint."

  We have the ability and the responsibility to choose to direct our actions
on a virtuous path.
  When we weigh a particular act, to determine whether it is moral or
spiritual, our criterion should be the quality of our motivation.  When someone
deliberately makes a resolution not to steal, if he or she is simply motivated
by the fear of getting caught and being punished by the law, it is doubtful
whether engaging in that resolution is a moral act, since moral considerations
have not dictated his or her choice.
  In another instance, the resolution not to steal may be motivated by fear of
public opinion: "What would my friends and neighbors think?  All would scorn
me.  I would become an outcast."  Though the act of making a resolution may be
positive, whether it is a moral act is again doubtful.
  Now, the same resolution may be taken with the thought "If I steal, I am
acting against the divine law of God."  Someone else may think, "Stealing is
nonvirtuous; it causes others to suffer."  When such considerations motivate
one, the resolution is moral or ethical; it is also spiritual.  In the
practice of Buddha's doctrine, if your underlying consideration in avoiding a
nonvirtuous act is that it would thwart your attainment of a state
transcending sorrow, such restraint is a moral act.

  A conventional enemy may harm us, but patience and a refusal to retaliate
can bring us benefit both in this life and in the future.  However, tolerance
towards [our own] hostile disturbing emotions and attempts at peaceful
coexistence with them will never bring us any reward.  They will do us nothing
but harm if we don't take steps to drive them out.  No conventional enemy can
do us such harm.  The most an ordinary enemy can do is to defeat us for a
short space of time or destroy us in this life, but the disturbing emotions
will insure our misery for many lifetimes to come.
  Shantideva says:
        All other foes that I appease and wait upon
        Will show me favors, give me every aid,
        But should I serve my dark defiled emotions,
        They will only harm me, draw me down to grief.

  There is a story about a princess who had a small eye problem that she felt
was really bad.  Being the king's daughter, she was rather spoiled and kept
crying all the time.  When the doctors wanted to apply medicine, she would
invariably refuse any medical treatment and kept touching the sore spot on her
eye.  In this way it became worse and worse, until finally the king proclaimed
a large reward for whoever could cure his daughter.  After some time, a man
arrived who claimed to be a famous physician, but actually was not even a
doctor.
  He declared that he could definitely cure the princess and was admitted to
her chamber.  After he had examined her, he exclaimed, "Oh, I'm so sorry!"
"What is it?" the princess inquired.  The doctor said, "There is nothing much
wrong with your eye, but there is something else that is really serious."  The
princess was alarmed and asked, "What on earth is so serious?"  He hesitated
and said, "It is really bad.  I shouldn't tell you about it."  No matter how
much she insisted, he refused to tell her, saying that he could not speak
without the king's permission.
  When the king arrived, the doctor was still reluctant to reveal his findings.
Finally the king commanded, "Tell us what is wrong.  Whatever it is, you have
to tell us!"  At last the doctor said, "Well, the eye will get better within a
few days--that is no problem.  The big problem is that the princess will grow
a tail, which will become at least nine fathoms long.  It may start growing
very soon.  If she can detect the first moment it appears, I might be able to
prevent it from growing."  At this news everyone was deeply concerned.  And the
princess, what did she do?  She stayed in bed, day and night, directing all
her attention to detecting when the tail might appear.  Thus, after a few
days, her eye got well.
  This shows how we usually react.  We focus on our little problem and it
becomes the center around which everything else revolves.  So far, we have
done this repeatedly, life after life.  We think, "My wishes, my interests, my
likes and dislikes come first!"  As long as we function on this basis, we will
remain unchanged.  Driven by impulses of desire and rejection, we will travel
the roads of samsara without finding a way out.  As long as attachment and
aversion are our sources of living and drive us onward, we cannot rest.

Dr.  Cutler: "... one of the reasons I brought up the topic of challenge at
work," I said to the Dalai Lama, "is because it relates to a concept that
seems to come up frequently these days in psychological literature, the
concept of flow.*  This concept is increasingly mentioned in articles on human
happiness, and this state can commonly occur at work...  while engaged in
activity, there's a feeling of effortlessness, a sense of total control over
what one is doing....  Although flow can occur in any activity, some
investigators have found that Americans experience more flow at work than they
do in their leisure time."

The Dalai Lama: "You really like this flow, Howard!" the Dalai Lama exclaimed
with an amused chuckle.  "... no matter how nice that state may be, I don't
think it is the most important source of satisfaction, fulfillment, or
happiness....  For one thing, you can't be in that state at all times....  So
through this flow, even if you get some temporary kind of happiness, it will
not be an ongoing thing.  I think this flow state is not reliable or
sustainable, and I think it's much more important to develop other sources of
satisfaction through one's work that are brought about by training one's mind,
shaping one's outlook and attitude, integrating basic human values in the
workplace.  For example, dealing with one's destructive emotions while at
work, reducing anger, jealousy, greed, and so on, and practicing relating to
others with kindness, compassion, tolerance, these are much more important and
stable sources of satisfaction than simply trying to create flow as much as
possible."

Dr.  Cutler: "...To the Dalai Lama, true happiness is associated with a sense
of meaning, and arises on the basis of deliberately cultivating certain
attitudes and outlooks.  True happiness may take longer to generate, and
requires some effort, but it is this lasting happiness that can sustain us
even under the most trying conditions of everyday life."

* flow is defined here as [people] being so completely absorbed in their work
  that they lose track of time.

Dzogchen could be defined as a way to relax completely.  This can be clearly
understood from the terms used to denote the state of contemplation, such as
"leave it just as it is" (cog bzhag), "cutting loose one's tension" (khregs
chod), "beyond effort" (rtsol bral), and so on.  Some scholars have classified
Dzogchen as a "direct path," comparing it to teachings such as Zen, where this
expression is often used.  In Dzogchen texts, however, the phrases "direct
path" and "nongradual path" (cig car) are never used, because the concept of a
"direct path" implies necessarily that there must be, on the one hand, a place
from which one departs, and on the other, a place where one arrives.  But in
Dzogchen there is a single principle of the state of knowledge, and if one
possesses this state one discovers that right from the beginning one is
already there where one wants to arrive.  For this reason the state is said to
be "self-perfected" (lhun grub).

  Since the situation in which we live is much changed but the attitude of
people who are in that situation is at variance with the times, this is one of
the causes of unnecessary pain, unnecessary problems.  Therefore, education is
needed to communicate that the concept of violence is counterproductive, that
it is not a realistic way to solve problems, and that compromise is the only
realistic way to solve problems.  Right from the beginning, we have to make
this reality clear to a child's mind--the new generation.  In this way, the
whole attitude towards oneself, towards the world, towards others, can become
more healthy.  I usually call this "inner disarmament." Without inner
disarmament, it is very difficult to achieve genuine, lasting world peace.
  ...Through inner disarmament we can develop a healthy mental attitude, which
also is very beneficial for physical health.  With peace of mind, a calm mind,
your body elements become more balanced.  Constant worry, constant fear,
agitation of mind, are very bad for health.  Therefore, peace of mind not only
brings tranquility in our mind but also has good effects on our body.
  With inner disarmament, now we need external disarmament.  As I mentioned
earlier, according to today's reality, there no longer is room for war, for
destruction.  From a compassionate viewpoint, destruction, killing others, and
discriminating even against one's enemy are counterproductive.  Today's enemy,
if you treat them well, may become a good friend even the next day.

Q: Where does hatred come from?

A: That is a question which requires long hours of discussion.  From the
Buddhist viewpoint, the simple answer is that it is beginningless.  As a
further explanation, Buddhists believe that there are many different levels of
consciousness.  The most subtle consciousness is what we consider the basis of
the previous life, this life and future lives.  This subtle consciousness is
a transient phenomenon which comes about as a consequence of causes and
conditions.  Buddhists have concluded that consciousness itself cannot be
produced by matter.  Therefore, the only alternative is to accept the
continuation of consciousness.  So that is the basis of the theory of rebirth.

Where there is consciousness, ignorance and hatred also arise naturally.
These negative emotions, as well as the positive emotions, occur right from
beginningless time.  All these are a part of our mind.  However, these
negative emotions actually are based on ignorance, which has no valid
foundation.  None of the negative emotions, no matter how powerful, have a
solid foundation.  On the other hand, the positive emotions, such as
compassion or wisdom, have a solid basis: there is a kind of grounding and
rootedness in reason and understanding, which is not the case with afflictive
emotions like anger and hatred.

The basic nature of the subtle consciousness itself is something neutral.  So
it is possible to purify or eliminate all of these negative emotions.  That
basic nature we call Buddha-nature.  Hatred and negative emotions are
beginningless; they have no beginning, but there is an end.  Consciousness
itself has no beginning and no end; of this we are certain.

   When the sun is freed from clouds, the sun becomes clear and bright.
Similarly, when obstructions to omniscience are abandoned, wisdom becomes
clear light.
   How does wisdom that is like the sun in a sky free from clouds dawn?  It
is described as yogic direct perception.  Between ordinary beings--those born
in dependence upon their individual karma--and yogins, here we are considering
yogins.  Their wisdom is not speculation from an inferential point of view, as
is the case with ordinary beings.  Neither is it pensive and lacking in
clarity.  Rather, it sees directly, for which reason it is called yogic direct
perception.  When we ordinary beings think about a thing, there is something
in the way, obstruction, due to which we do not see clearly and directly.
When those obstructions--the afflictive obstructions and the obstructions to
omniscience--have been dispelled, then knowledge arises as yogic direct
perception.
   When yogic direct perception arises, how does it see?  It sees phenomena
in a conventional context and it also sees reality in an ultimate context.  In
the conventional context, wisdom sees the shapes, colors, and defining
characteristics of whatever things exist in worldly realms, individually and
without mixing them, just as they are.  This wisdom knows the varieties of
phenomena.  Similarly, in the context of reality, wisdom sees the meaning of
emptiness directly; this wisdom knows the mode of all phenomena.  In
dependence upon release from the afflictive obstruction and the obstruction to
omniscience, the wisdoms knowing the modes and the varieties actually arise.
   Someone in whom those two wisdoms are present is a buddha.

   Sometimes people mistakenly look on vows and pledges as if these were a
type of punishment, but this is not at all the case.  For example, just as
we follow certain methods of eating and drinking to improve our health and
certainly not to punish ourselves, so the rules the Shakymuni Buddha
formulated are for controlling counter-productive ill-deeds and ultimately for
overcoming afflictive emotions, because these are self-ruinous.  Thus, to
relieve oneself from suffering, one controls the motivations and deeds
producing suffering for one's own sake.  Realizing from his own experience
that suffering stems from one's own afflictive emotions as well as actions
contaminated with them, he sets forth styles of behavior to reduce the problem
for our own profit, certainly not to give us a hard time.  Hence, these rules
are for the sake of controlling sources of harm.

Giving with an open heart brings us joy and directly benefits others.  Goods
are then shared more equitably within our society and among nations, soothing
the ill-feeling of social inequity and promoting world peace.  Sharing is a
source of our continued existence as a species.  As His Holiness the Dalai
Lama says, it is not survival of the fittest, but survival of those who
cooperate the most, that makes a species prosper.  None of us exists
independently; we have to depend on others simply to stay alive.  Thus,
helping others and sharing wealth benefits both self and others.  Generosity
makes us happy now, enables our species to continue to prosper, and creates
positive karma that brings us prosperity in the future.  In addition, it is an
essential trait of an enlightened being.  Who ever heard of a stingy Buddha?

    I have made the point in the past that it is not necessary to consider
someone one's guru from the very outset simply because one has heard the
explanation of the Buddha's teachings from that person.  At first, it is much
better if one does not have that kind of attitude toward them, simply
regarding them as a Dharma-friend.  One gets teachings, and time goes by.
Then, when one feels that one knows that person quite well, and can take them
as one's guru without any danger of transgressing the commitments that
accompany such a relationship, when one has that kind of confidence, then one
can go ahead and take him or her as one's guru.  The Lord Buddha himself made
it quite clear in both the Vinaya sutras and in the Mahayana scriptures, and
even in the Tantrayana, in a very detailed fashion, what the qualities of a
teacher should be.  This is why I often criticize the Tibetan attitude of
seeing whatever the guru does as good, of respecting everything that the guru
does right from the start without the initial period of examination.  Of
course, if the guru is really qualified, then to have such an attitude is
very worthwhile.
    Take the cases of Naropa and Marpa, for example.  Sometimes it appears as
though some of the things Tilopa asked of Naropa, or Naropa of Marpa, were
unreasonable.  Deep down, however, these requests had great meaning.  Because
of their great faith in their gurus, Naropa and Marpa did as instructed.
Despite the fact that they appeared to be unreasonable, because the teachers
were qualified, their actions had some meaning.  In such situations, it is
necessary that from the disciple's side all of the actions of the teacher be
respected.  But this cannot be compared to the case of ordinary people.
Broadly speaking, I feel that the Buddha gave us complete freedom of choice to
thoroughly examine the person who is to be our guru.  This is very important.
Unless one is definite, one should not take them as a guru.  This preliminary
examination is a kind of precautionary measure.

13.  Transforming suffering into the path
      Even if someone tries to cut off your head
      When you haven't done the slightest thing wrong,
      Out of compassion take all his misdeeds
      Upon yourself--
      This is the practice of Bodhisattvas.
        -- from "The Thirty-seven Practices of Bodhisattvas"
           by Gyelsay Togme Sangpo
  Although we have done nothing to deserve it, someone may attack us, beat
us, or perpetrate other forms of violence on us.  Certainly it is tempting to
get angry in such a situation, but our anger will do no good.  In fact, this
person is creating the cause for his own unfortunate rebirth by attacking us,
and the karma he creates is even heavier if we hold any of the three sets of
vows: pratimoksha, Bodhisattva, or tantric.  Thus, we cultivate compassion,
and wish to take the person's karma and resultant suffering on ourselves.  For
example, if a crazy person attacks a person who is sane, the latter will not
only not fight back but try to help, by giving him medicine and wanting him to
get well.  The sane person sees that the crazy person does not know what he is
doing.  He is out of control.
  Similarly, when someone harms us, we should recognize that he too is out
of control and is being led by his three poisonous attitudes.  Similarly, we
can remember that we are experiencing the ripening result of harmful actions
we did in past lives, so why blame the other person?  In addition, that person
is causing our negative karma to be exhausted now, rather than later when the
result could be much more difficult to bear.  In this way, we will not be
angry or retaliate, but will pray for and try to help the other.  In "The
Eight Verses of Thought Transformation," it says, "Whenever I meet a person of
bad nature who is overwhelmed by negative energy and intense suffering, I will
hold such a rare one dear, as if I had found a precious treasure." People like
this suffer greatly because they think only of themselves, not of others, and
thus they are worthy of compassion, the wish that they be free from suffering
and its causes.
  Being patient when harmed by others does not mean that we take no action
to prevent harm from occurring.  Rather, patience frees our mind from the fog
of anger and gives us the clarity and kindness to respond to a situation in a
helpful way.  Free of anger, we look for ways to resolve conflict other than
seeking revenge.

  Shantideva expresses tremendous courage, which transcends all boundaries
of space and time, in a verse of his "Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life"
(Bodhicaryavatara).  He writes:
      As long as space endures,
      As long as sentient beings remain,
      Until then, may I too remain
      And dispel the miseries of the world.
  When the altruistic intention is supported by insight into emptiness, and
particularly by the direct realization of emptiness, one is said to have
attained the two dimensions of bodhichitta which are known as conventional and
ultimate bodhichitta.  With both these practices of compassion and wisdom, the
practitioner has within his or her hands the complete method for attaining the
highest spiritual goal.  Such a person is truly great and worthy of
admiration.
  If one is able to cultivate these spiritual qualities within oneself then,
as Chandrakirti writes very poetically in his Entry to the Middle Way
(Madhyamakavatara), with one wing of altruistic intention and another wing of
insight into emptiness, one can traverse the whole of space and soar beyond
the state of existence to the shores of fully enlightened buddhahood.
  ...make an effort to contemplate, study and meditate, but without any
shortsighted expectations.  You should have the same attitude as Shantideva --
that as long as space exists you will remain to dispel suffering in the world.
When you have that kind of determination and courage to develop your capacity,
then a hundred years, an aeon, a million years are nothing to you.
Furthermore, you will not consider that the different human problems we have
here and there are in any way insurmountable.  Such an attitude and vision
bring some kind of real inner strength.

The Tantric Way of Purifying One's Views
    The second important attitude is the Tantric way of purifying one's views,
which means to transform one's ordinary and dualistic views and conceptions
into a higher spiritual vision.
    For instance, you transform the place where teachings are received from an
ordinary classroom into a complete and perfected mandala of the deities.  You
view the teacher as a pure form of Shen Lha Okar, the Buddha of Compassion, by
mentally transforming him from an ordinary person into an enlightened one who
has manifested in a human body to guide all sentient beings.  You transform
your companions and classmates from ordinary beings into deities and
goddesses, and believe that they all have love, compassion, and care for all
sentient beings.
    The purpose of transforming your views into pure visions toward these
objects is to realize the extraordinary nature of this experience.  This gives
you a special reason to receive blessings and powers from the teacher (lama),
the enlightened ones (Sangye), the deities (yidam), and the female
manifestations of the enlightened ones (khadro), in order to develop your
wisdom and stability.  This is the essence of the practice of purifying one's
view according to the Tantric ways.

Desire is the source of endless problems.  The more desires we have, the more

told me that the more he developed his company, the more he felt like making
it even bigger.  And the more he tried to make it bigger, the more he found he
had to lie and fight mercilessly against his competitors.  He had come to
realize that wanting more and more made no sense, and that he only had to
reduce the size of his business for competition to become less fierce so he
would be able to carry out his work honestly.  I found his testimony very

I--What Is a Treasure?
  According to the Nyingma School, the Treasures are most often comprised of
spiritual instructions concealed by enlightened beings for the purpose of
discovery at a later predestined time when their message will invigorate the
Buddhist teaching and deepen spiritual understanding.  Central to this process
is the figure of the Treasure revealer (gter ston)--the person who acts as a
medium for the re-emergence of this inspired material into the human world.
Accordingly, beginning in the eleventh century and continuing into the
present, the Nyingma School identifies a large number of Treasure revealers
and grants authoritative status to their discoveries.
  The idea that religious truth lies concealed within the world of phenomena
awaiting discovery by spiritually gifted people is by no means a concept
exclusive to the Nyingma School or Tibetan Buddhism as a whole.  Throughout
Buddhist literature there are numerous descriptions of teachings being
inherently present in the phenomenal world ready to be perceived by
individuals possessing inspired levels of consciousness and, accordingly,
spiritual revelations have surfaced on numerous occasions throughout the
course of Buddhist history.

Dalai Lama: Generally speaking, awareness, in the sense of our familiar, day-
to-day mental processes, does not exist apart from or independent of the
brain, according to the Buddhist view.  But Buddhism holds that the cause of
this awareness is to be found in a preceding continuum of awareness, and that
is why one speaks of a stream of awareness from one life to another.  Whence
does this awareness arise initially?  It must arise fundamentally not from a
physical base but from a preceding continuum of awareness.

The continuum of awareness that conjoins with the fetus does not depend upon
the brain.  There are some documented cases of advanced practitioners whose
bodies, after death, escape what happens to everyone else and do not decompose
for some time--for two or three weeks or even longer.  The awareness that
finally leaves their body is a primordial awareness that is not dependent upon
the body.  There have been many accounts in the past of advanced practitioners
remaining in meditation in this subtle state of consciousness when they died,
and decomposition of their body was postponed although the body remained at
room temperature.

The real source of my suffering is self-centeredness: my car, my possession,
my well-being.  Without the self-centeredness, the suffering would not arise.
What would happen instead?  It is important to imagine this fully and to focus
on examples of your own.  Think of some misfortune that makes you want to lash
out, that gives rise to anger or misery.  Then imagine how you might respond
without suffering.  Recognize that we need not experience the misery, let
alone the anger, resentment, and hostility.  The choice is ours.

Let's continue with the previous example.  You see that there is a dent in the
car.  What needs to be done?  Get the other driver's license number, notify
the police, contact the insurance agency, deal with all the details.  Simply
do it and accept it.  Accept it gladly as a way to strengthen your mind
further, to develop patience and the armor of forbearance.  There is no way to
become a Buddha and remain a vulnerable wimp.  Patience does not suddenly
appear as a bonus after full enlightenment.  Part of the whole process of
awakening is to develop greater forbearance and equanimity in adversity.
Santideva, in the sixth chapter of his Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life,
eloquently points out that there is no way to develop patience without
encountering adversity, and patience is indispensable for our own growth on
the path to awakening.

Dayata (Om) Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi Swaha.

A mantra is that which protects the mind.  Through this mantra, which is the
perfection of wisdom itself, we can overcome the demon of ignorance that
possesses us and find unsurpassable happiness.  It protects the minds of those
who practice it from all fears and describes how to make the transition from
worldly existence to the supreme state beyond sorrow.  It is a mantra of great
knowledge because it saves us from the poison of ignorance and its imprints.
It is an unsurpassable mantra because it frees us from suffering and its
causes as no other path of insight can.  The incomparable is the state beyond
suffering.  Since it helps us to attain that state, it is comparable to the
incomparable.  It totally pacifies suffering because it rids us of all the
troubles of the world and their causes.  The world here refers to ordinary
beings like us.  Our troubles are many but foremost are birth, aging,
sickness, and death.  This mantra does not deceive us and it is true because
wisdom sees things as they actually are without any error or deception.  It is
therefore transcendent.

I am interested not in converting other people to Buddhism but in how we
Buddhists can contribute to human society, according to our own ideas.  I
believe that other religious faiths also think in a similar way, seeking to
contribute to the common aim....

Just as Buddha showed an example of contentment, tolerance, and serving others
without selfish motivation, so did Jesus Christ.  Almost all of the great
teachers lived a saintly life--not luxuriously like kings or emperors but as
simple human beings.  Their inner strength was tremendous, limitless, but the
external appearance was of contentment with a simple way of life.

...the motivation of all religious practice is similar--love, sincerity,
honesty.  The way of life of practically all religious persons is contentment.
The teachings of tolerance, love, and compassion are the same.  A basic goal
is the benefit of humankind--each type of system seeking in its own unique
ways to improve human beings.  If we put too much emphasis on our own
philosophy, religion, or theory, are too attached to it, and try to impose it
on other people, it makes trouble.  Basically all the great teachers, such as
Gautama Buddha, Jesus Christ, or Mohammed, founded their new teachings with a
motivation of helping their fellow humans.  They did not mean to gain anything
for themselves nor to create more trouble or unrest in the world.

Most important is that we respect each other and learn from each other those
things that will enrich our own practice.  Ever if all the systems are
separate, since they each have the same goal, the study of each other is
helpful.

  Our teacher, Sakyamuni Buddha, is one among the thousand Buddhas of this
aeon.  These Buddhas were not Buddhas from the beginning, but were once
sentient beings like ourselves.  How they came to be Buddhas is this.
  Of body and mind, mind is predominant, for body and speech are under the
influence of the mind.  Afflictions such as desire do not contaminate the
nature of the mind, for the nature of the mind is pure, uncontaminated by any
taint.  Afflictions are peripheral factors of a mind, and through gradually
transforming all types of defects, such as these afflictions, the adventitious
taints can be completely removed.  This state of complete purification is
Buddhahood; therefore, Buddhists do not assert that there is any Buddha who
has been enlightened from the beginning.

    ...everbody thinks that compassion is important, and everyone has
compassion.  True enough, but the Buddha gave uncommon quintessential
instructions when he taught the methods for cultivating compassion, and the
differences are extraordinarily important.
    Generally, everyone feels compassion, but the compassion is flawed.  In
what way?  We measure it out.  For instance, some feel compassion for human
beings but not for animals and other types of sentient beings.  Others feel
compassion for animals and some other types of sentient beings but not for
humans.  Others, who feel compassion for human beings, feel compassion for the
human beings of their own country but not for the human beings of other
countries.  Then, some feel compassion for their friends but not for anyone
else.  Thus, it seems that we draw a line somewhere.  We feel compassion for
those on one side of the line but not for those on the other side of the line.
We feel compassion for one group but not for another.  That is where our
compassion is flawed.  What did the Buddha say about that?  It is not
necessary to draw that line.  Nor is it suitable.  Everyone wants compassion,
and we can extend our compassion to everyone.

4.  Seven-Limbed Practice

    The seven parts of the practice are encompassed by two practices--the
purification of negativities and the enhancing of the store of merit.  When
you engage in the practice, it is very important to understand that each and
every one of the seven limbs has its individual purpose and significance, and
only with such knowledge can you engage properly in the practice.  The seven
limbs are: prostration, offering, confession, rejoicing, requesting to turn
the wheel of the dharma, entreating not to enter into nirvana, and dedication
of merit.
    ...For the practice of confession, which is the third of the seven limbs,
it is very important to have the factor of regret; without this factor there
is no possibility of purifying the negativities....  The great yogi Milarepa
said: "When I examined whether or not confession could purify the
negativities, I found that it is regret that cleanses them." In order to
generate regret, it is important to see the destructive nature of negative
actions and also to understand the law of causality.
    Based on a disciplined mind, we experience happiness; based on an
undisciplined, untamed mind, we undergo suffering.  We should think that if we
are not able to make any progress from our present state of mind, which always
indulges in negative thoughts, there is not much hope for us.  So, if we are
able to think in such terms, we will be able to really see the destructive
nature of negative actions, and also that the store of negative actions that
we have is inexhaustible, like a rich person's bank balance.  Without the
recognition of the destructive nature of the negative forces, we will never be
able to develop the deep factor of regret from the depth of our hearts.
    If we do not engage in a proper practice of dharma, it seems that we may
expend all our store of merit in mundane pleasures.  It is very important to
have this faculty of regret in our practice of purification and confession.

9. Glorious Lama (excerpt)

...Those with faith have a refuge.
Those with compassion have an altruistic attitude.
Those with incisive knowledge have realization.
Those with respect and devotion have blessings.

Those with shame avoid carelessness.
Those who avoid carelessness have a guarded mind.
Those who have a guarded mind have vows and samaya.
Those who have vows and samaya have spiritual attainments.

Calm and self-control are signs of listening to the Dharma;
Few passions, signs of meditation;
Harmony with everyone is the sign of a practitioner;
Your mind at ease, the sign of accomplishment.

The root of phenomena is your own mind.
If you tame your mind, you are a practitioner.
If you are a practitioner, your mind is tamed.
When your mind is tamed, that is liberation.

The Special Features of Dzogchen

    In the early translation school of the Nyingma, a system of nine yanas is
taught.  Three of these--the paths of the Sravaka, pratyekabuddha, and
bodhisattva--constitute the sutra tradition, while the tantric tradition
consists of six levels--the three outer tantras and the three inner tantras.
The tradition of Dzogchen, or Atiyoga, is considered to be the pinnacle of
these nine yanas.  The other, lower, yanas are said to be philosophical
systems that depend on ordinary consciousness, and so the path is based on
that ordinary consciousness.  Here the distinction being made is between
ordinary mind--sem--and pure awareness--rigpa.  The ninth yana, the most
majestic, is beyond ordinary consciousness, for its path is based on rigpa,
not on the ordinary mind.
    Throughout beginningless time, there has always been present, within us
all, a pure awareness--that in-dwelling rigpa which in Atiyoga is evoked in
all its nakedness, and which constitutes the practice.
    ...The ground for all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana is the
fundamental innate mind of clear light, and these phenomena are its radiance
or display.  While we are following the path, in order for all the impure
aspects of our experience to be purified on the basis of that rigpa--or, you
can say, that fundamental innate mind of clear light--there is no other means
apart from that fundamental and innate state itself, which is therefore the
very essence of the path.  Finally, when the fruition is made fully evident,
it is just this fundamental innate mind of clear light itself, free from
obscuration, that constitutes the attainment of fruition.
    ...Any given state of consciousness is permeated by the clear light of
rigpa's pure awareness.  However solid ice may be, it never loses its true
nature, which is water.  In the same way, even very obvious concepts...  arise
within the expanse of rigpa and that is where they dissolve.  On this point,
Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima says that all objects of knowledge are permeated
by clear light, just as a sesame seed is permeated by its oil.  Therefore,
even while the coarser states of the six consciousnesses are functioning,
their subtle aspect--that of clear light--can be directly introduced by means
of those states themselves, through blessings and through pith instructions.
    Here lies the extraordinary and profound implication of the Dzogchen
teachings.  When you are basing your path on the fundamental innate mind of
clear light, you will employ skilful means to block the coarse and subtle
states of energy and mind, as a result of which the state of clear light
becomes evident, and on this you base your path.  But in Dzogchen, even while
the six consciousnesses are fully functioning, by means of those very states
you can be directly introduced to their subtle aspect of clear light in your
immediate experience, and you then meditate by focusing one-pointedly on that
aspect.  As you meditate in this way, resting in this non-conceptual state,
gradually your experience of clear light becomes increasingly profound, while
coarser thoughts and concepts dwindle away.
    The most difficult task is to differentiate between ordinary mind and
rigpa.  It is easy enough to talk about it.  You can say, for example, that
rigpa has never been confused, while ordinary mind has fallen under the
influence of concepts and is mired in confusion.  But to be introduced to the
direct experience of the essence of rigpa is far from being easy.  And so
Dodrupchen says that although your arrogance might be such that you assume you
are meditating on the ultimate meaning of rigpa, there is a danger that "you
could end up meditating on the clear, empty qualities of your ordinary mind,
which even non-Buddhist practitioners are capable of doing." He is warning us
to be careful.

     Perfection", translated by Geshe Thubten Jinpa and Richard Barron

    Patience is like a beautiful ornament.  When you become a person with
great patience, it brings a certain element of charm to your life.  You are
loved by others, and you give no problems to your friends.  You bring an
element of joy, happiness, and calmness to other people's lives--your friends,
your family, and the community.  You do not have to ask to be accepted;
everyone longs for your presence.  Everyone looks up to you and respects you,
not because you have worked for that or expected it, not because you were
competing for their favor, but simply because of the nature of patience.  You
are respected and trusted, and you acquire dignity with the practice of
patience.  When you are honored, it is with sincerity, and it is something you
can live up to.
    ...Just hearing about patience does not mean you are experiencing it now
or will easily develop it.  To lay the ground for training the mind, you must
first tame the mind.  To tame the mind, it is extremely important to do the
basic shamata [tranquility meditation, calm abiding] practice, which develops
calmness and tranquility.  Then you can add the practice of patience,
understanding the benefits of patience and reminding yourself to take
advantage of the available antidotes.

    The Sanskrit word for compassion, karuna, has the implication of "that
which blocks or prevents bliss."  In general, when we develop compassion, we
develop very strongly the attitude that cannot bear the suffering of other
beings.  We wish for it to end and for them to become free.  Although we do
not actually experience others' suffering at that time, the strength of the
attitude that cannot bear their suffering causes our mind also to become
unhappy.  This is the general sense in which compassion blocks bliss....
    Only the power of a union of method and wisdom--namely the union of
compassion, as a greatly blissful awareness, and the discriminating awareness
of voidness--allows us to attain the total release of supreme nirvana, namely
enlightenment.

    There is a tradition of reciting prayers of request to the spiritual
teachers of the lineage at the beginning of each study session, starting with
the Buddha Shakyamuni and ending with our own personal teachers.  What do we
request?  As we chant each verse, we take to mind the inspiring qualities of
the great masters mentioned in it and ask them to bless us to develop
compassion, wisdom and power similar to their own.  Blessings are experienced
in the form of a transformation which affects our body, speech and mind.  Our
mind becomes more serviceable and flexible, our way of speaking and acting
more constructive.  We become more open to the message of how to bring about
inner transformation that has been handed down through this long line of
spiritual teachers.
    Our teachers pass on the instructions they have received from their own
teachers, the knowledge they have culled from their reading and everything
they have understood and experienced as a result of their personal practice,
without holding anything back.  They are motivated by compassion and their
deep wish to help us.  To communicate it to us they choose whatever means are
most effective--sometimes stern, sometimes gentle.  This process must take
place in an atmosphere of mutual trust, something very rare in relationships
today.  In the past the relationship between students and teachers was even
closer and more trusting than that between siblings--and in Tibet brothers and
sisters generally enjoyed a close and loving bond.  Today this is a dying
tradition, yet a good relationship between student and teacher is vital even
for the communication of secular knowledge, let alone where spiritual wisdom
is concerned.

    We have happiness of mind and freedom from anxiety to just the degree that
our minds are tamed....  Once we want happiness and do not want suffering, we
should engage in the means to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering.
Practice is based on reasoning, not force; it is up to oneself.
    The time for engaging in these techniques is now.  Some feel, "I did not
succeed in this lifetime; I will ask a lama for help in my future life."  To
think that we will practise in the future is only a hope.  It is foolish to
feel that the next life will be as suitable as this.  No matter how bad our
condition is now, since we have a human brain, we can think; since we have a
mouth, we can recite mantra.  No matter how old one may be, there is time for
practice.  However, when we die and are reborn, we are unable even to recite
om mani padme hum.  Thus, it is important to make all effort possible at this
time when we have obtained the precious physical life-support of a human.

will not feel so much hatred and disgust.  There may be resentment, and we may
not be able to love that person more than before, but almost automatically
there will be a certain sympathy that will lessen or end our hatred and allow
us to forgive.

    Compassion is a theme the Dalai Lama returns to over and over again.  I
also know he has meditated on compassion every morning without fail for the
past half century.  In an interview, I asked the Dalai Lama to give me his
take on compassion.  Lhakdor [his translator], as usual, was by his side.
    "Compassion is something like a sense of caring, a sense of concern for
others' difficulties and pain," the Dalai Lama said.  "Not only family and
friends, but all other people.  Enemies also.  Now, if we really analyze our
feelings, one thing becomes clear.  If we think only of ourselves, forget
about other people, then our minds occupy a very small area.  Inside that
small area, even a tiny problem appears very big.  But the moment you develop
a sense of concern for others, you realize that, just like ourselves, they
also want happiness; they also want satisfaction.  When you have this sense of
concern, your mind automatically widens.  At this point, your own problems,
even big problems, will not be so significant.  The result?  Big increase in
peace of mind.  So, if you think only of yourself, only your own happiness,
the result is actually less happiness.  You get more anxiety, more fear."
    "I was thirty-two years old when I developed a strong experience of
compassion," he told me....  "Often when I reflect on the meaning and benefits
of altruistic mind, tears came." Lhakdor translated: "...When he meditated on
compassion, he would sometimes be filled with joy and appreciation.  And there
is a strong sense of concern for others accompanied by a feeling of
sadness....  And when His Holiness reflected on certain profound explanations
on emptiness, this would also trigger a strong emotion."
    "I think that strong conviction or strong emotions actually give more
inner strength," the Dalai Lama explained.  "So when I face some problems or
criticism, for example, criticism from the Chinese, of course, little
irritation sometimes..."  "But then he'll have this feeling of compassion for
them," Lhakdor translated.  "He'll regret they're not making positive
connection with him.  But his sentiment is, although there is this negativity,
may it also give positive fruit."
    "Now, the understanding of emptiness helps a lot toward developing
compassion.  There's no doubt it reinforces compassion," the Dalai Lama said.
Lhakdor elaborated: "Emptiness allows us to have an understanding about
ultimate reality.  It helps us to appreciate the wisdom of interdependence--a
fundamental law of nature.  We gain an appreciation that we are all basically
related.  It is because of this interrelatedness that we are able to empathize
with the suffering of others.  With empathy, compassion flows naturally.  We
develop genuine sympathy for others' suffering and the will to help remove
their pain.  Emptiness thus strengthens positive emotions like compassion."
    Emptiness and compassion.  Wisdom and method.  These are the twin pillars
of the Dalai Lama's practice--everything we need to know about spiritual
practice.  Both qualities are needed; they strengthen each other.  Once we
realize we are all interconnected, it is difficut not to feel some of
compassion for the problems of our fellow human beings.  And once we come by
a feeling of compassion, we start to get a glimpse of the timeless truth of
interdependence, of emptiness.
    The Dalai Lama looked thoughtful.  After some time, he turned to me, "I
think one thing I'm quite sure," he said.  "I can tell you, the twin practice
of emptiness and compassion is... effective." Then he lapsed into Tibetan
again.  Lhakdor translated.  "His Holiness can say with conviction: if you
meditate on emptiness and compassion, so long as you make the effort, then His
Holiness is sure that, day in and day out, you will get tangible benefit.
Your whole attitude will change." "....These things about compassion are
something living--according to my own experience," the Dalai Lama went on.  "I
tell some of my experiences to other people, share some of my feelings, then
other people understand: there is something real, something living."

    ...it is difficult to recognize an authentic teacher, because these
qualities are internal.  We can not depend upon external factors, but external
factors are what we see.  It is very difficult to see the inner qualities of
another person.  A businessman might be friendlier to us than our best friend,
while his unseen motivation is merely to make a sale.  Likewise, if a
"teacher" acts in a very kind and loving manner towards us it does not
necessarily mean that he is compassionate and selfless, because we cannot see
his motivation.  We also cannot determine a teacher's qualifications based
upon her fame, or whether she has thousands of students.  So the seeker is
left with this paradox.
    There is no simple solution, but there are things we can do.  First, it is
important that we familiarize ourselves with the characteristics* discussed by
Kongtrul Rinpoche.  Second, we must maintain awareness of our own motivation
during the process of finding a teacher.  Am I seeking a teacher in order to
attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, or am I seeking
to fulfill my need to acquire the prestige associated with a famous teacher,
or am I merely attracted to a lama's beautiful retreat land or the social
scene of a hip sangha, and so on.
    These motivations need to be acknowledged if we are to recognize an
authentic wisdom teacher, because the teacher you find is related to your
karma, and your karma is intimately connected to your motivation.
Fortunately, there are methods that help us purify our motivation and create
the proper conditions for finding a wisdom teacher, such as bringing our
awareness to our motivations as much as possible, doing daily meditation
practice, and praying to the Triple Gem [Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha] that we
will meet and recognize an authentic wisdom teacher.

* "Whatever lama is followed must definitely have these qualities: He holds a
pure lineage since he has not contradicted the commitments and prohibitions of
the three vows....  He should be very learned...  clear about the sutras,
tantras, and shastras.  His mind-stream should be so saturated with compassion
that he loves all the limitless sentient beings as his only child.  He should
be expert in the outer tripitakas and on the inner level he should be expert
in the ritual of the four classes of tantras of the secret mantra.  He should
have manifested the outstanding noble qualities of abandomnent and realization
in his mind-stream by having relied upon practicing the meaning of this.  He
gathers fortunate disciples by the four ways of attracting: generosity,
pleasant speech, his conduct should benefit others, and he should act in
accord with the dharma."

...when we talk about the notion of self in Buddhism, it is important to bear
in mind that there are different degrees or types.  There are some types of
sense of self which are not only to be cultivated but also to be reinforced
and enhanced.  For instance, in order to have a strong determination to seek
Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings, one needs a very strong
sense of confidence, which is based upon a sense of commitment and courage.
This requires a strong sense of self.  Unless one has that identity or sense
of self, one will not be able to develop the confidence and courage to
strongly seek this aim.  In addition, the doctrine of Buddha-nature gives us a
lot of encouragement and confidence because we realize that there is this
potential within us which will allow us to attain the perfection that we are
seeking.  However, there are different types of sense of self which are rooted
in a belief in a permanent, solid, indivisible entity called "self" or "I."
There is the belief that there is something very concrete or objective about
this entity.  This is a false notion of self which must be overcome.

...by respecting and serving your teachers you exhaust karma whose effects you
would otherwise experience in the miserable realms.  Your action of serving
the teacher expends these miserable effects and replaces them with only slight
harm to your body and mind in this lifetime, either in actuality or in dreams.
In addition, the benefits of respecting and serving your teachers are
tremendous, such as a collection of virtue which surpasses even the roots of
virtue that you derive from making offerings to limitless buddhas, and so
forth.  As the Sutra of Ksitigarbha says:
    "Those whom the teachers care for will purify the karma that would
otherwise cause them to wander through the miserable realms for ten million
limitless eons.  They purify this karma with harm to their bodies and minds in
this lifetime.  This harm includes sickness such as an infectious disease with
fever and calamities such as famine.  They may purify their karma by merely
undergoing something as little as a dream or a scolding.  They produce more
roots of virtue in one morning than those who give gifts to, worship, or
observe precepts from limitless tens of millions of buddhas.  Those who
respect and serve their gurus are endowed with unimaginable good qualities."

    ...if we remain clinging to this life even for one day, we are misusing
our time.  In this way, we can waste months and years on end.  Because we
don't know when our lives will finish, we should remain mindful and well
prepared.  Then, even if we die tonight, we will do so without regret.  If we
die tonight, the purpose of being well prepared is borne out; if we don't die
tonight, there is no harm in being well prepared, because it will still
benefit us.
    But when we leave the world of humans, we do so without a protector or
supporter and the total responsibility falls on us.  We only have our own
intelligence to rely on at that time, so we must expend our own effort in
order to protect ourselves.  As the Buddha said, "I have shown you the path to
liberation; know that liberation depends on you." We must put strenuous effort
into gaining freedom from the lower migrations, liberation from samsara,
freedom from conventional existence and solitary salvation.
    The body is compared to a guest house; it is a place to stay for just a
short time and not permanently.  At present, the guest of consciousness is
staying in the guest house of the body, like renting a place to stay.  When
the day comes for consciousness to leave, the guest house of the body must be
left behind.  Not being attached to friends, the body, wealth and possessions
is the practice of the Bodhisattvas.

    ...the Transcendent Conqueror presented the two truths with respect to all
inner and outer things, like sprouts and everything else.  Genuine truth is
described as being simply the authentic object of the noble ones' original
wisdom that sees what is authentic and true; there is no identity actually
established there for conceptual mind to find.  Relative truth is the false
object seen from the perspective of the conceptual mind whose eye of wisdom is
completely covered by the cataract of ignorance, as is the case with ordinary
beings.  It is therefore posited as being this conceptual mind.  The object
perceived does not exist in the way that this mind perceives it to be.
    Thus, the Teacher explained that every thing found holds two natures
within: a genuine nature and a relative one.  From among these two, the object
of the noble ones' authentic vision is the precise nature of reality, genuine
truth, and the object of false seeing is relative truth.

    ...we find Agastya, born to a family of Brahmans so illustrious as to be
called "an ornament of the earth," living as an ascetic on the island of Kara
in the Indian Ocean....  "On what accomplishment have you set your hopes?"
Indra asked Agastya the Bodhisattva.  "What is the object of your wishes that
has led you to leave your sorrowful friends and relatives, desert a household
and possessions that had been your happiness, and enter this way of life that
destroys all pleasures?"
    The Bodhisattva replied according to the Dharma, in a way that immediately
laid Indra's anxiety to rest.  "Repeated births tend to great sorrow," he
said.  "So do the calamities of old age, sickness and death.  All are just a
disturbance to the mind.  My vow is to save all sentient beings from these
evils."
    Relieved, Indra immediately offered, in return for such candid truth, the
fulfillment of any desire Agastya might name.  "May the fire of covetousness
that burns insatiably even after obtaining a beloved wife, children, power and
riches never enter my heart," Agastya said.  "Excellent, excellent," applauded
Indra and urged Agastya to request the fulfillment of still another desire.
    "May the fire of hatred burn far from me," Agastya said.  Pleased by this
game, in which Agastya so ingeniously taught the Dharma while appearing to
request the fulfillment of his desires, Indra urged him to go on.  But this
time he was startled to hear Agastya's words.  "May I never hear, see, speak
to, nor endure the annoyance and pain of staying with a fool," Agastya said.
"What do you mean?" Indra asked.  "Those in distress deserve sympathy; the
root of distress is foolishness.  How can you claim to be compassionate when
you abhor the very presence of those most due sympathy?"
    Then Agastya reasoned in this way, to prove to Indra that one should
associate not with the foolish but with men of wisdom.  "A fool cannot be
cured even by medical treatment," he said.  "Habituated to wrong conduct
because of a deficiency in moral education, he urges his neighbors to follow
his impetuous way, inflamed by self-conceit and the affectation of wisdom.
When reprimanded, he becomes angry.  There is no help for him."  "How true,"
Indra said.  "Let me hear more jewellike, well spoken sentences."
    "May I see, hear, live with and converse with a wise man," Agastya said,
"for these reasons: because the wise man, walking the path of virtue, draws
others along with him, and is never roused to impatience by harsh words spoken
for his own good."  Again Indra was delighted.

(2) What one has to abandon: how to get rid of arrogance by means of an
antidote--
    "I'm not beyond my karma, the deeds I've done;
    I'll still fall ill, age, die, and leave my friends."
    Think like this again and yet again
    And with this remedy avoid all arrogance.
"I will be sick, I will grow old, I will die, I will be separated from those
I love, my relations and so forth.  In such manner, the fully ripened effect
of my actions will come to me and to no one else, and I am therefore not above
depending on what I did in former lives."  To think like this again and again
is the antidote to such things as arrogance: make every effort not to become
arrogant by meditating on this antidote.

For every minute you are angry, you lose 60 seconds of happiness.

~
Inwardly, we defend against death by the very structure of our ego.  Our ego
claims to have the ability to provide us with happiness based on its belief in
its own permanent existence.  On the one hand, to believe in ego results in
denying death.  On the other, to accept death is to question the very nature
of ego as a permanent, on-going structure and to confront very strong defense
mechanisms.  As a result, we have strong resistance to contemplating death.
This resistance is also the same resistance that comes up when we meditate.
Please recognize it for what it is and move on.

Question: Could you please say something on the three kinds of suffering?

His Holiness: One kind of suffering is like a headache or like yesterday's
flu: discomfort in the nose, watery eyes, and so forth.  In short, it includes
all of those kinds of gross physical and mental sufferings that in ordinary
parlance we usually call "suffering."  This is the first category.

Then the second category is as follows.  When we feel hungry and begin to take
food, at first we feel very happy.  We take one mouthful, then two, three,
four, five...  eventually, though it is the same person, the same food, and
the same time period, we begin to find the food objectionable and reject it.
This is what is meant by the "suffering of change."  Practically every worldly
happiness and pleasure is in this second category.  Compared to other forms of
suffering, at the beginning these more subtle forms of suffering seem
pleasurable; they seem to afford us some happiness, but this is not true or
lasting happiness, for the more we become acquainted with them, the more
involved we become with them, the more suffering and trouble they bring us.
That is the second category.

Now as for the third category, I think it is fair to say that it is one's own
body.  Roughly speaking, this is what it is.  It is the body which is the
fruit of afflictions, a body originally created by afflictions.  Because the
body is created by such causes, it is of the very nature of suffering.  It
comes to act as the basis of suffering.  This, then, is the third category.

     edited by Jose Ignacio Cabezon, published by Snow Lion Publications.

    One point I should make here is that some people, especially those who see
themselves as very realistic and practical, are sometimes too realistic and
obsessed with practicality.  They may think, "The idea of wishing for the
happiness of all beings, of wanting what is best for every single one, is
unrealistic and too idealistic.  Such an unrealistic idea cannot contribute in
any way to transforming the mind or to attaining some kind of mental
discipline, because it is completely unachievable."
    ...They feel there is simply no point in thinking about all beings since
there is an infinite number of them.  They may conceivably be able to feel
some kind of connection with some fellow human beings on this planet, but they
feel that the infinite number of beings throughout the universe has nothing to
do with their own experience as individuals.
    ...What is important here, however, is to grasp the impact of cultivating
such altruistic sentiments.  The point is to try to develop the scope of our
empathy in such a way that we can extend it to any form of life with the
capacity to feel pain and experience happiness.  It is a matter of recognizing
living organisms as sentient, and therefore subject to pain and capable of
happiness.
    ...Such a universal sentiment of compassion is very powerful, and there is
no need to be able to identify, in specific terms, with every single living
being in order for it to be effective.
    ...Given patience and time, it is within our power to develop this kind of
universal compassion.

Position
    Different body postures open or compress particular energetic channels and
influence the flow of subtle energy.  We use this understanding to aid
specific processes in the practice.  The Tibetan tradition considers the
negative emotions to be more closely associated with the primary channel on
the right side of the body in men and on the left in women.  When a man sleeps
on his right side, the channel that carries mostly negative prana is forced a
little closed and the left channel opens.  Also the lung, the physical organ,
on that side is a bit compressed so the opposite lung is a little more
responsible for the breath.  You are probably already familiar with effects
from lying on your side: when you lie on your right side you find it easier to
breathe through your left nostril.  For men, we consider this position
beneficial to the movement of the positive wisdom prana through the left
channel.  Women benefit from the reverse, opening the wisdom channel that is
on their right side by sleeping on their left.  This affects dreams in a
positive fashion and makes the dream practice easier.  Opening the flow of the
wisdom prana is a provisional expedient, as ultimately we want the balanced
prana to move into the central channel.
    Furthermore, by paying attention to posture, awareness is kept more stable
during sleep.  Where I come from, most people sleep on a three-foot by six-
foot Tibetan carpet.  If one moves too much, one falls out of bed.  But that
does not usually happen, because when one sleeps on something small, the
position of the body is held in the sleeping mind throughout the night....
Here, in the big beds of the West, the sleeper can rotate like the hands of a
clock and not fall, but holding the position anyway will help maintain
awareness.

The term emptiness does not carry here any connotation of void or of absolute
nothingness.  It should be understood as the naturally open and serene state
of the mind.  Thus, to affirm the emptiness of phenomena does not in any way
mean that they do not exist in the way that the horn of a hare or skyflowers
do not exist.  Instead, emptiness refers to the insight that, at the ultimate
level, both interior phenomena--sensations, perceptions and the "I"--and
exterior phenomena--all the appearances of the phenomenal world--have no real
existence, although they do appear in different forms.  The Heart Sutra
summarizes this as follows:
    Form is emptiness, emptiness is form,
    Emptiness is not other than form,
    Form is not other than emptiness.

    Nonviolence does not mean that we remain indifferent to a problem.  On the
contrary, it is important to be fully engaged.  However, we must behave in a
way that does not benefit us alone.  We must not harm the interests of others.
Nonviolence therefore is not merely the absence of violence.  It involves a
sense of compassion and caring.  It is almost a manifestation of compassion.
I strongly believe that we must promote such a concept of nonviolence at the
level of the family as well as at the national and international levels.  Each
individual has the ability to contribute to such compassionate nonviolence.
    How should we go about this?  We can start with ourselves.  We must try to
develop greater perspective, looking at situations from all angles.  Usually
when we face problems, we look at them from our own point of view.  We even
sometimes deliberately ignore other aspects of a situation.  This often leads
to negative consequences.  However, it is very important for us to have a
broader perspective.
    We must come to realize that others are also part of our society.  We can
think of our society as a body, with arms and legs as parts of it.  Of course,
the arm is different from the leg; however, if something happens to the foot,
the hand should reach down to help.  Similarly, when something is wrong within
our society, we must help.

    According to Highest Yoga Tantra, some persons attain Buddhahood in one
lifetime, and because these persons are not born with a body adorned with the
major and minor marks they must achieve such a body through the practice of
deity yoga.
    Meditation on oneself as undifferentiable from a deity is the special
cause... for attaining Buddhahood.  If one meditated only on emptiness and
did not cultivate any method--either that of the Perfection or that of the
Mantra Vehicle--one would fall to the fruit of a Hinayana Foe Destroyer.  In
order to attain the definite goodness of the highest achievement, Buddhahood,
deity yoga is needed.  Also, ...one must view one's body clearly as a divine
body and train in the pride of being a deity.  Without deity yoga the Mantra
path is impossible; deity yoga is the essence of Mantra.

    Often we see other sentient beings as hassles: "This mosquito is
disturbing me.  Those politicians are corrupt.  Why can't my colleagues do
their work correctly?" and so on.  But when we see sentient beings as being
more precious than a wish-fulfilling jewel, our perspective completely
changes.  For example, when we look at a fly buzzing around, we train
ourselves to think, "My enlightenment depends on that fly."  This isn't
fanciful thinking because, in fact, our enlightenment does depend on that fly.
If that fly isn't included in our bodhicitta, then we don't have bodhicitta,
and we won't receive the wonderful results of generating bodhicitta--the
tremendous purification and creation of positive potential.
    Imagine training your mind so that when you look at every single living
being, you think, "My enlightenment depends on that being.  The drunk who just
got on the bus--my enlightenment depends on him.  The soldier in Iraq--my
enlightenment depends on him.  My brothers and sisters, the teller at the
bank, the janitor at my workplace, the president of the United States, the
suicide bombers in the Middle East, the slug in my garden, my eighth-grade
boyfriend, the babysitter when I was a kid--my enlightenment depends on each
of them."  All sentient beings are actually that precious to us.

    We think of ourselves as being the child of specific parents, as belonging
to a certain gender and race, as a citizen of a specific nation, and as a
member of a caste, class and community within that country, etc.  Our
identification with these transient reference points, be they racial,
linguistic, cultural, conceptual, or gender-specific, can become lifelong love
affairs, hate affairs, or guilt affairs.  What Guru Rinpoche's birth
symbolizes for me is the fact that, from the first moment, he recognized the
unborn and undying nature of his mind, primordially pure awareness.  He
identified with that, rather than with his body, wherever it may have come
from, be it a womb, a lotus, a stork, or a cabbage patch.  Whatever physical,
linguistic, or conceptual worlds he adopted, he wore as ephemeral ornaments on
the infinite expanse of timeless awareness.
    ...Guru Rinpoche was not an individual who followed a spiritual path until
illumination.  He was an enlightened being who appeared in different guises
entirely as a manifestation to help others, including the guise of an
individual who followed the spiritual path.

    ...if a person is experiencing some kind of mental dysfunction, it is
frequently understood that the mind itself has become too withdrawn in upon
itself, and that there is a corresponding physiological process involving the
energies themselves, which are closely associated with consciousness, also
entering into a dysfunctional state.
    So, in the Buddhist view, it can happen, for example, that one's mind will
become depressed because of some environmental event.  As a result of the mind
becoming depressed, there is a chemical, maybe an electrochemical,
transformation in the brain that has now occurred.  The mental dysfunction
will then be aggravated.  When that happens, there is a further chemical
response, which then avalanches upon itself.
    ...on occasion, without any special external event taking place, there can
simply be a dysfunction or disruption in the balance of the elements within
the body.  In that event, the internal circumstances are the dominant,
principal cause.

    Enlightenment is not only...  devoid of various types of contaminations,
pollutions, suffering, and afflictive emotions...  but is also free from
various dualistic appearances.  When you achieve such a state, you are
unfettered from all elaborations in the form of subject-object duality and
appearances of conventionality.
    You are free not because the subject-object duality or conventional
appearances are objects of elimination in the sense that they are negative
emotions.  Rather, you are free because these elaborations cease to exist when
you reach the state of enlightenment.  In such a state, the mind of
enlightenment or omniscience is such that it is totally merged with emptiness.
To such a mind, no elaborations exist.

Guilt and Shame
    When we meditate, things from the past come up, and we have to work with
them.  We may remember times when we treated others horribly--hurting their
feelings, deceiving them, repaying their kindness with spite, manipulating
them, cheating them.  While regret for these actions is appropriate and
necessary to purify these karmas, we often fall into guilt and shame instead.
Guilt and shame are obstacles to overcome on the path, because they keep us
trapped in our self-centered melodrama entitled "How Bad I Am." Regret, on the
other hand, realizes that we erred, leads us to purify, and motivates us to
refrain from acting like that in the future.
    How do we counteract guilt and shame?  One way is to recognize that the
person who did that action no longer exists.  You are different now.  Is the
person who did that action five years ago the same person you are now?  If she
were exactly the same person, you would still be doing the same action.  The
present "you" exists in a continuum from that person, but is not exactly the
same as her.  Look back at the person you were with compassion.  You can
understand the suffering and confusion she was experiencing that made her act
in that way.

Our relationship with our practice must be based on reason and common sense.
The principal subject to be learned is the nature of the two levels of reality
[conventional and ultimate], the stages of which can be approached through a
combination of hearing, contemplation and meditation.  It is very important
always to remember contemplation, which is the analysis and investigation of
the teachings through the use of reason.  The two truths are speaking about
reality, not some intellectual fabrication.  To investigate the teaching
critically is fully encouraged in the same way that medical students are
encouraged to apply their theories to real life and thus to witness their
validity....  Time may flow on, but the essential nature of the deeper
problems and mysteries that human beings encounter in the course of their
lives remains the same.  Contemplation of the teachings of Buddha Shakyamuni
is merely contemplation of certain facets of reality, and it will cause to
unfold within us a deeper understanding of ourselves, our minds, and the
nature of our sense of being.  As the teachings are merely pointing out key
facts of life, facts that, if realized, cause one to evolve in wholesome
directions, a critical investigation of them will only inspire trainees with
confidence.  Reason well from the beginning and then there will never be any
need to look back with confusion and doubt.

b. Keeping bounteousness in mind

    Possessions are ephemeral and essenceless
    Know this and give them generously to monks,
    To brahmins, to the poor, and to your friends:
    Beyond there is no greater friend than gift.

Having realized that possessions such as food are inconstant and fluctuate,
that in changing and transforming they are devoid of essence, in order to make
them meaningful try to use them properly, giving to those with good qualities
(monks and brahmins), to those who suffer (the poor, the sick, and so forth),
to those who help you (friends) and to those you venerate (spiritual teachers
and parents).  Even beyond the world there is no friend more sublime, more
beneficial, than giving, because it gives rise directly and indirectly to
ripened effects that are inexhaustible.

With a determination to accomplish
The highest welfare for all sentient beings
Who surpass even a wish-granting jewel
I will learn to hold them supremely dear.

    Never mind neglecting other sentient beings, you should take them as a
treasure through which temporary and final aims can be achieved and should
cherish them one-pointedly.  Others should be considered more dear, more
important than yourself.  Initially, it is in dependence upon sentient
beings--others--that you generate the altruistic aspiration to highest
enlightenment.  In the middle, it is in relation to sentient beings that you
increase this good mind higher and higher and practice the deeds of the path
in order to achieve enlightenment.  Finally, in the end, it is for the sake of
sentient beings that you achieve Buddhahood.  Since sentient beings are the
aim and basis of all of this marvelous development, they are more important
than even a wish-granting jewel, and should always be treated with respect,
kindness, and love.

    You might think, "My mind is so full of the afflictive emotions.  How
could I possibly do this?"  However, the mind does what it is used to.  What
we are not used to, we find difficult, but with familiarity, previously
difficult things become easy.  Thus Shantideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva
Deeds says,

    "There is nothing which, with time, you cannot get used to."

    Eventually, through the power of stabilizing meditation in which the
mind is set one-pointedly on its object of observation, an initial mental
pliancy--a serviceability of mind--is generated.  As a sign that mental
pliancy is about to be generated, a tingly sensation is felt at the top of the
head.  This pleasant feeling is compared to that of a warm hand placed on top
of the head after it has been shaved.  When mental pliancy has been generated,
a favorable wind, or energy, circulates in the body, engendering physical
pliancy.  Through this wind, or air, pervading the entire body, the
unserviceability of the body such that it cannot be directed to virtuous
activities in accordance with your wishes is removed.  The generation of
physical pliancy, in turn, engenders a bliss of physical pliancy, a sense of
comfort throughout the body due to the power of meditative stabilization.
    The bliss of physical pliancy induces a bliss of mental pliancy, making
the mind blissful.  At first, this joyous mental bliss is a little too
buoyant, but then gradually it becomes more steady; at this point, one attains
an unfluctuating pliancy.  This marks attainment of a fully qualified
meditative stabilization of calm abiding.

    The more we generate an attitude of contentment in our lives, the happier
we will be and the more open we will be to engage in genuine Dharma practice.
Letting go of the eight worldly concerns brings mental peace right now.
    The defining characteristic of a thought or action being Dharma is whether
or not we're attached to the happiness of this life.  The eight worldly
concerns are completely involved with attachment to the happiness of this
life.  How can we practice genuine Dharma when our self-centered mind is
fixated on getting our own way and making everyone and everything around us
suit our preferences and needs?
    That doesn't mean the happiness of this life is bad or wrong.  The Buddha
did not say that we should suffer in this life so that we'll get our reward in
heaven.  The objects we're attached to and have aversion for aren't the
problem; there's nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure and happiness.
Those aren't the issue.  Rather, attachment to pleasant feelings and to the
people, objects, and situations that cause them, and aversion to unpleasant
ones--it is these emotions that create trouble.  They make us unhappy and
propel us to harm others in order to get what we want.  The troublemakers of
attachment and hostility are what we want to abandon, not people and things.
There is nothing wrong with being happy.  But when we're attached to it, we
actually create more unhappiness for ourselves.

When engaging in hearing, it is important to mix the mind, to familiarize the
mind, with what is being heard.  The study of religion is not like learning
about history.  It must be mixed with your mental continuum; your mind should
be suffused with it.  A sutra says that the practices are like a mirror; your
actions of body, speech, and mind are like a face to be seen in the mirror;
and through the practices you should recognize faults and gradually get rid of
them.  As it is said in the oral transmission, "If there is enough space
between yourself and the practices for someone else to walk through, then you

Question: What is the relationship of the mind and afflictive emotions?

DL: The very entity of the mind, its nature of mere luminosity and knowing, is
not polluted by defilements; they do not abide in the entity of the mind.
Even when we generate afflictive emotions, the very entity or nature of the
mind is still mere luminosity and knowing, and because of this we are able to
remove the afflictive emotions.  If you agitate the water in a pond, it
becomes cloudy with mud; yet the very nature of the water itself is not dirty.
When you allow it to become still again, the mud will settle, leaving the
water pure.  How are defilements removed?  They are not removed by outside
action, nor by leaving them as they are; they are removed by the power of
antidotes, meditative antidotes.

    The very root of this yearning for happiness, this yearning to be free of
suffering, is the fundamental expression of the buddha-nature.  If for the
time being we turn our gaze away from the myriad ways that we can stray from
the agenda--trying to find happiness by buying a more luxurious car, or a
bigger house, or getting a better job--and just come back to the primary
desire of wishing to be happy, we find at the very source of our yearning for
happiness the buddha-nature wanting to realize itself.  It's like a seed that
wants to spring into the sunlight.  Sometimes it gets terribly contorted, when
we want to injure somebody else for the sake of our own happiness, but the
fundamental yearning is something to be embraced.

    When you meditate with concentration, there are three particular
experiences that arise: bliss, clarity, and nonthought.  Sometimes you feel
great joy, sometimes your mind is very clear, and sometimes there is complete
equanimity.  To experience these you do not need to meditate for a long time,
although for a beginner these experiences will not last long because of the
limited ability of a beginner's meditation.
    The experience of meditative bliss is greater than ordinary worldly
happiness.  Sometimes when you are meditating, a feeling of blissfulness
suddenly arises from the subtle state of your mind and pervades your entire
body.  This bliss is healthy and brings out your inner qualities.  Some people
use drugs to induce blissfulness and visions, but drugs are external supports
that cannot bring lasting happiness.  The bliss experienced in meditation can
last for many days, according to your ability to meditate.  When you
experience this kind of bliss, on the outside you might look very poor, but
inside you remain very joyful.
    The second main experience in meditation is clarity.  Sometimes while
meditating you can suddenly feel that your mind is very clear and bright.
Even if you are meditating in the dark, you do not feel heavy or tired.
Sometimes your body feels very light and your mind is very clear, and many
kinds of reflections appear.  Clarity brings great wisdom and the ability to
read other people's minds, as well as to see your own past and future lives.
    The third main experience is nonthought, or a state of equanimity without
distractions.  Beginners can also experience this.  Nonthought is more settled
than the experiences of bliss and clarity.  If you have thoughts, they
suddenly dissolve and you can remain continuously in meditation.  As your
ability to meditate develops, your mind becomes more and more settled, so that
you can meditate for one hour or one week or one month without being
distracted by thoughts.  You simply remain in the natural state for as long as
you want.

    ...when you probe deeply you will find that no matter how high an
existence a realm may be, even though it may be the highest state of
existence, as long as it is in this cycle of existence the beings there are in
the nature of sufferings, because they have the sufferings of pervasive
conditioning and are therefore under the influence or command of contaminated
actions and delusions.  As long as one is not able to be free from such an
influence, there is no place for permanent peace or happiness.
    Generally, the experiences that you normally regard as pleasurable and
happy, such as having the physical comfort of good facilities and so forth, if
they are examined at a deeper level, will be revealed to be changeable and
therefore in the nature of suffering.  They provide you with temporary
satisfaction; because of that temporary satisfaction you regard them as
experiences of happiness.  But if you keep on pursuing them, they will again
lead to the experience of suffering.  Most of these pleasurable experiences
are not really happiness in the true sense of the word, but only appear as
pleasure and happiness in comparison to the obvious sufferings that you have.

    Once the conventional nature of the mind has been identified, then,
through analysing its nature, finally we will gradually be able to identify
the ultimate nature of the mind.  If that is done, there is great progress
unlike anything else.
    At the beginning we should meditate for half an hour.  When we rise from
the session and various good and bad objects appear, benefit and harm are
manifestly experienced.  Therefore, we should develop as much as we can the
realisation that these phenomena do not exist objectively and are mere
dependent-arisings of appearances, like illusions [in that they only seem to
be inherently existent].  We should meditate in this way in four formal
sessions: at sunrise, in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

  Bodhichitta is the one practice we cannot do without.  Even if we have been
given the precious oral instructions on realizing the nature of mind, they
will not be the sufficient cause for realization if we have not learned to
generate Bodhichitta.  The great Dzogchen yogi Patrul Rinpoche said,
    If we have only one thing, the precious Bodhichitta is enough.
    If we have nothing else, we must have the method of the precious
        Bodhichitta.
  We should learn to develop Bodhichitta in a twofold way: through our
aspirations and through our actions.  Aspiration Bodhichitta is our initial
wish that all sentient beings be liberated from the vast ocean of samsara's
suffering.  Action Bodhichitta requires that we first generate aspiration
Bodhichitta, and practice the Six Paramitas as the method to establish the two
benefits of 1) attaining Buddhahood oneself to 2) be of ultimate benefit to
others.  The way to practice aspiration and action Bodhichitta was taught by
the omniscient Patrul Rinpoche, who said,
    The instructions for aspiration [Bodhichitta] are to practice the
        Four Immeasurables;
    The instructions for action [Bodhichitta] are to practice the Paramitas.

    What are the techniques for heightening or lowering the mind?  To heighten
the mind, you think about something that enlivens it, but not an object that
would generate desire.  For instance, you could reflect on the value of
developing the meditative stabilization of calm abiding or on the value of
having attained a life as a human or on the value of having human
intelligence.  Through such reflection, your mind will gain courage, thereby
causing its mode of apprehension to become heightened.
    If, despite such a technique, laxity is not cleared away, it is better to
end the session and go to a place that is bright or that is high with a vast
view where you can see a great distance.  Or, expose yourself to fresh air, or
throw cold water on your face.  Then, return to the session.
    When the mind becomes too heightened and thus scattered, what will lower
its mode of apprehension?  As a technique to withdraw the mind inside, you
should reflect on a topic that sobers the mind, such as the suffering of
cyclic existence, or think "In the past I have been ruined by distraction, and
again now I will be ruined by distraction.  If I do not take care now, it will
not be good."  This will lower the mode of apprehension of the mind.
    Since this is the case, a person who is cultivating calm abiding needs to
be in a state where such reflections will move the mind immediately.
Therefore, prior to working at achieving calm abiding, it is necessary to have
become convinced about many topics--such as those involved in the four
establishments in mindfulness--through a considerable amount of analysis.  In
an actual session of cultivating calm abiding one is performing stabilizing
meditation, not analytical meditation, but if one has engaged in considerable
analysis of these topics previously, the force of the previous reflection
remains with the mind and can be recalled.  Thus, when you switch to such
topics in order either to elevate or lower the mind, the mind will be
immediately affected.  In this way, if ascertainment has been generated
previously, then reflecting on the value of meditative stabilization or the
value of a human lifetime will immediately heighten the mind, and reflection
on sobering topics such as the nature of the body or the ugliness of objects
of desire will immediately lower its mode of apprehension.
    ...recognize when laxity and excitement arise and know the techniques for
overcoming them.

    How is it that mistaken mind overwhelms the unmistaken mind, unmistaken
reality?  To give an example, during the day when the sun is shining one does
not see any stars and thus one would think that there are no stars at all,
that they just plain do not exist.  Just so, afflictive emotions shine so
brightly and are so powerful that it is as if unmistaken reality, unmistaken
mind, does not exist at all.  When you seek out this unmistaken mind from
within, you come to understand that there is an unmistaken mind--a reality of
the mind--that does not die, that does not scurry after pleasure and pain.
This mind that does not follow after pleasure and pain has a mode of being
that is emptiness--but not an emptiness in the sense of an empty house or an
empty vessel; rather, it is endowed with the inconceivable self-effulgence of
unmistaken reality, of pristine wisdom.
    When you search for this that is beyond mistaken mind, mistaken mind just
stops; gradually like dawn there comes to be a time when pristine wisdom
manifests a little.  With the beginning of dawn there is not just darkness but
some light, and so it is when the self-effulgence, the self-color, the self-
nature of the pristine wisdom shows itself a little; one generates a suspicion
that there is wisdom beyond mistaken mind.  As Aryadeva says, "When you
generate doubt thinking that there might be such a reality, cyclic existence
is torn to tatters." How does cyclic existence come to be torn to tatters, or
wrecked, made into a mess by doubt?  For instance, if a table is wrecked,
broken up, it cannot perform the function of a table; just so, when the self-
effulgence of unmistaken pristine wisdom begins to dawn with this state of
doubt, cyclic existence is wrecked and torn to tatters.

    The Jewel in the Crown Sutra states, "Donning the armor of loving-
    kindness, while abiding in the state of great compassion, practice
    meditative stabilization that actualizes the emptiness possessing
    the best of all qualities.  What is the emptiness possessing the
    best of all qualities?  It is that which is not divorced from
    generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditative stabilization,
    wisdom, or skillful means." Bodhisattvas must rely on virtuous
    practices like generosity as means to thoroughly ripen all sentient
    beings and in order to perfect the place, body, and manifold retinue.
      -- from "Stages of Meditation" by Kamalashila

...Note that practice of generosity and the other perfections is essential.
This is because the fully enlightened state of Buddhahood is produced by the
realization of favorable causes and conditions.  There is no causeless
production and nothing is produced by contrary causes.  A Bodhisattva has many
wonderful advantages to help enhance the welfare of sentient beings; every
virtue performed by such a noble being is very powerful and effective.
Therefore, Bodhisattvas earnestly engage in the practice of the method aspects
of the path, including the six perfections, in order to swiftly actualize the
state of Buddhahood.

    Of the three kayas, the Dharmakaya is linked to our mind, Sambhogakaya to
our speech, or communicative principle, and the Nirmanakaya to our ordinary
body.
    The process of the three blendings in brief is as follows.
    We experience the clear light of the waking state naturally during cIimax,
and it can also be induced with yogic methods.  Moreover, we naturally
experience it at the moment of going to sleep, and at the moment of death.
The principle here is that this clear light mind as experienced in each of the
three occasions (waking, sleep and death) is the highest experience of our
consciousness, and in it we dwell in a mental state of blissful, formless non-
duality similar to that of the Dharmakaya wisdom of a buddha.  Thus when we
experience the clear light mind in any of these three occasions we should
blend it with the Dharmakaya.
    The first movement from this clear light mind is likened to the
Sambhogakaya experience.  In the waking state this occurs in our meditation
when we fall out of the clear light that is induced with yogic techniques and
the conceptual mind is aroused.  In sleep it occurs after the clear light of
the moment of entering sleep passes and we begin to dream.  At death it occurs
when the clear light flash at the moment of death passes and we leave our body
and enter the bardo realm.
    A buddha's Sambhogakaya is only visible to an arya, or saint, and not to
an ordinary being; in the same way our thoughts, dreams, and bardo visions are
not visible to ordinary beings but nonetheless are experiences of form.  These
subtle form experiences are to be linked to the natural realization of the
illusory, blissful, and perfect nature of being; they are to be seen as an
illusory theater made manifest for the benefit of the world.  In other words,
they are to be blended with the Sambhogakaya.  This is the second set of three
blendings.
    The third blending is that of blending rebirth with the Nirmanakaya.
Rebirth from the bardo of the waking state occurs every time that we arise
from a meditation session and once more go about our ordinary life; rebirth
from the bardo of the sleep / dream state occurs when we wake up and once more
enter the work-a-day world; and rebirth from the bardo of becoming, or death
bardo, occurs when we complete the unwinding process of the afterlife state
and once again are ready to enter into a new body.
    The basic principle underlying these three blendings is that what occurs
to us at the time of death also occurs to us in miniature form at the time of
going to sleep and can be induced in the waking state by means of the inner
heat yogas.

    Now, as [in the past], the concept of a transcendent god as creator has a
powerful and inspiring impact on the lives of those who believe in it.  The
sense that their entire destiny lies in the hands of an all-powerful,
omniscient and compassionate being leads them to try to understand the
workings and key message of this transcendent being.  Then, when they come to
realise that this transcendent being embodies love and infinite compassion,
they try to cultivate love and compassion towards their fellow beings as the
qualities through which to express love for their creator.  They also gain
confidence and inspiration through a sense of intimacy or connectedness to
this loving, transcendent being.
    Although, metaphysically speaking, Buddhists reject any notion of a
transcendent creator or god, some individual Buddhists do relate to certain
higher beings, such as the goddess Tara, as an independent and real being with
power over their destiny.  For these practitioners Tara is their sole refuge,
their greatest object of veneration and their trusted guardian and protector.
What this suggests is that the inclination to seek refuge in an external
source is something deeply natural for us as human beings.
    But it is also clear that for other people the metaphysical concept of a
transcendent being is unacceptable.  Questions form in their minds, such as:
who created the creator--in other words--where does the transcendent being
come from?  And how can we posit a true beginning?  People with this type of
mental disposition look elsewhere for explanations.

    Due to misunderstanding each other's needs and concerns, miscommunication
occurs on the international level as well [as the personal level].  In all
these situations--personal and international--freeing ourselves from our
narrow understanding of a situation by seeing it from the other's viewpoint is
an effective remedy for anger.  We can ask ourselves, "If I had grown up in
that person's family, society, time in history, and cultural conditions, what
would my needs and concerns be in this situation?"
    When we look at the situation from the other person's viewpoint, sometimes
we see that she perceives it differently than we thought she did.  Other
times, we realize that we have little idea of how a situation appears to
another person or what her needs and concerns are.  Therefore, we need to ask
her; and when she responds, we need to listen, without interrupting.  It is
all too easy, when someone explains her view to us, to correct her or tell her
that she should not feel the way she does.  This only inflames the other
person, and convinces her, with good reason, that we don't understand.
Rather, we need to listen from our heart to what she says.  After she has
fully expressed herself, we can share our perspectives, and generally, a
productive discussion will ensue.

    ...it is extremely important to look inward and try to promote the right
kind of attitude, which is based on awareness of reality.  A sense of caring
for others is crucial.  And it is actually the best way of caring for oneself.
...the moment you think of others, this automatically opens our inner door--
you can communicate with other people easily, without any difficulties.  The
moment you think just of yourself and disregard others, then because of your
own attitude, you also get the feeling that other people also have a similar
attitude toward you.  That brings suspicion, fear.  Result?  You yourself lose
inner calmness.  Therefore, I usually say that although a certain kind of
selfishness is basically right--self and the happiness of that self are our
original right, and we have every right to overcome suffering--but selfishness
that leads to no hesitation to harm another, to exploit another, that kind of
selfishness is blind.  Therefore, I sometimes jokingly describe it this way:
if we are going to be selfish, we should be wisely selfish rather than
foolishly selfish.
    I feel that the moment you adopt a sense of caring for others, that brings
inner strength.  Inner strength brings us inner tranquility, more self-
confidence.  Through these attitudes, even though your surroundings may not be
friendly or may not be positive, still you can sustain peace of mind.

    If we do not uncover [our] problems--and I saw this in myself--we risk
placing a veneer of spirituality over deeply buried emotional wounds from
childhood that do not simply go away.
    ...When this happens there is greater potential for our spirituality to
become simply another expression of our personal pathology.  We can falsify
the qualities valued in the path without realizing it.  Renunciation can
become another level of denial and avoidance; compassion can become a sickly
sentimentality that has no substance to it.  Our desire to help others can
come from "compulsive caring," or a compulsion to sacrifice ourselves because
we feel worthless.  The Buddhist idea of emptiness can likewise be falsified
by the desire to disappear psychologically and merge or lose ego boundaries.
Lack of identity, formless vagueness, and absence of boundaries do not
exemplify the Buddhist idea of emptiness.  My own version of this
misconception was to try to live an ideal of the pure and pious only to find
it was a form of repression I could not ultimately sustain.
    At the heart of Buddhist practice is the search for a solution to our
fundamental wounds.  Healing the emotional damage we often carry within is
truly the object of this practice.  If we wish to resolve these problems, we
need to be open and honest about their reality within us.  Only when we do
will any spiritual practice address what we need.  The aim of Buddhist
practice is not a spiritual transcendence that dissociates from our suffering.
Nor is it the search for salvation in some form of external divine being that
we hope will save us in our distress.  As one of my teachers, Lama Thubten
Yeshe, once said, "Buddhism is very practical; you just have to recognize that
your mind is the cause of suffering.  If you change your mind, you can find
liberation."  This message is very simple but by no means easy to follow.  In
order to do so, however, we must begin to recognize where we are
psychologically wounded.

Direct Experience
    In the Dzogchen teachings, a teacher explains methods that you can apply
for discovering that state.  When you say that you are practicing or following
Dzogchen teachings, it doesn't mean that you are reciting some prayers or
mantras, or doing some visualization.  It means that, following a teacher and
using methods, you discover that state.  When you have discovered that state,
then you still need many kinds of methods for realizing it.  Discovering the
state of your real nature and realizing it are completely different things.
    Many people have the idea that when they have had some experience or
discovery, they are enlightened; however, this discovery does not mean they
are enlightened.  The state of enlightenment means you have direct knowledge
of what the state of rigpa is, and you are not just learning through
intellectual study.  When you follow a teaching in an intellectual way, you
have many ideas at first--thinking, judging, and making analysis.  You can
follow or reject these ideas; but when you have many problems, you discover
that perhaps this is not real knowledge.  It is like following something
blindly because you haven't had any direct experience.  Direct introduction
and discovering our real nature mean we have direct experience through our
senses, and that through these experiences we discover our real nature.
    For example, if I show you an object, you can look at it and know its form
and color.  Now if I ask you to forget about it, you can't.  If I ask you to
change your idea about that object, you can't.  Why?  Because seeing that
object is your direct experience.  Discovering your real nature is similar to
that.
    When you are studying in an intellectual way, you are following another
person's idea.  For example, you can believe your teacher today, but maybe
what your teacher says will not be true for you tomorrow.  You can always
change your ideas.  You have this problem because you have not discovered your
state.  This is the weak point of intellectual study.

    Howard Cutler: "Have there been situations in your life that you've
regretted?"
    Dalai Lama: "Oh, yes.  Now for instance there was one older monk who lived
as a hermit.  He used to come to see me to receive teachings, although I think
he was actually more accomplished than I and came to me as a sort of
formality.  Anyway, he came to me one day and asked me about doing a certain
high-level esoteric practice.  I remarked in a casual way that this would be a
difficult practice and perhaps would be better undertaken by someone who was
younger, that traditionally it was a practice that should be started in one's
midteens.  I later found out that the monk had killed himself in order to be
reborn in a younger body to more effectively undertake the practice..."
    Surprised by this story, I remarked, "Oh, that's terrible!  That must have
been hard on you when you heard..."  The Dalai Lama nodded sadly.  "How did
you deal with that feeling of regret?  How did you eventually get rid of it?"
    The Dalai Lama silently considered for quite a while before replying, "I
didn't get rid of it.  It's still there.  But even though that feeling of
regret is still there, it isn't associated with a feeling of heaviness or a
quality of pulling me back.  It would not be helpful to anyone if I let that
feeling of regret weigh me down, be simply a source of discouragement and
depression with no purpose, or interfere with going on with my life to the
best of my ability."
    At that moment, in a very visceral way, I was struck once again by the
very real possibility of a human being's fully facing life's tragedies and
responding emotionally, even with deep regret, but without indulging in
excessive guilt or self-contempt.  The possibility of a human being's wholly
accepting herself or himself, complete with limitations, foibles, and lapses
of judgment.  The possibility of recognizing a bad situation for what it is
and responding emotionally, but without overresponding.  The Dalai Lama
sincerely felt regret over the incident he described but carried his regret
with dignity and grace.  And while carrying this regret, he has not allowed it
to weigh him down, choosing instead to move ahead and focus on helping others
to the best of his ability.

Train yourself in three hard disciplines.
    These are the difficult practices of mindfulness, of expulsion and of
'interrupting the flow.'
    As for the first of these, the difficult practice of mindfulness, it is
necessary to recognize afflictive emotions as soon as they arise and it is
hard, at first, to remain sufficiently aware to be able to do this.  However,
when negative emotions arise, we should identify them as anger, desire or
stupidity.  Even when emotions have been recognized, it is not easy to drive
them out with the antidote.  If, for instance, an uncontrollably strong
emotion comes over us, so that we feel helplessly in its power, we should
nevertheless confront it and question it.  Where are its weapons?  Where are
its muscles?  Where is its great army and its political strength?  We will see
that emotions are just insubstantial thoughts, by nature empty: they come from
nowhere, they go nowhere, they remain nowhere.  When we are able to repel our
defiled emotions, there comes the difficult practice of 'interrupting the
flow.' This means that, on the basis of the antidote described, defiled
emotions are eliminated just like a bird flying through the air: no trace is
left behind.  These are practices in which we should really strive.

    Howard Cutler: "...am I right in assuming that you would consider solitary
meditation to be a productive activity?  Would you consider to be productive
our example of a monk who is a hermit, who has little contact with anybody
else and spends his or her life just in meditation, trying to achieve
liberation?"
    Dalai Lama: "Not necessarily.  From my viewpoint, there can be both
productive meditation and unproductive meditation."
    HC: "What's the difference?"
    DL: "[Some] practitioners and other kinds of meditators practice different
techniques, some with closed eyes, sometimes open eyes, but the very nature of
that meditation is to become thoughtless, in a state free of thoughts.  But in
a way, this is a kind of retreat, like they are running away from trouble.
When they actually face trouble, carry on their daily life and face some real
life problems, nothing has changed.  Their attitudes and reactions remain the
same.  So that kind of meditation is just avoiding the problem, like going on
a picnic, or taking a painkiller.  It's not actually solving the problem.
Some people may spend many years doing these practices, but their actual
progress is zero.  That's not productive meditation.  Genuine progress occurs
when the individual not only sees some results in achieving higher levels of
meditative states but also when their meditation has at least some influence
on how they interact with others, some impact from that meditation in their
daily life--more patience, less irritation, more compassion.  That's
productive meditation.  Something that can bring benefit to others in some
way."

    As human beings, we are all the same.  So there is no need to build some
kind of artificial barrier between us.  At least my own experience is that if
you have this kind of attitude, there is no barrier.  Whatever I feel, I can
express; I can call you "my old friend".  There is nothing to hide, and no
need to say things in a way that is not straightforward.  So this gives me a
kind of space in my mind, with the result that I do not have to be suspicious
of others all the time.  And this really gives me inner satisfaction, and
inner peace.
    So I call this feeling a "genuine realization of the oneness of the whole
of humanity".  We are all members of one human family.  I think that this
understanding is very important, especially now that the world is becoming
smaller and smaller.  In ancient times, even in a small village, people were
able to exist more or less independently.  There was not so much need for
others' co-operation.  These days, the economic structure has completely
changed....  We are heavily dependent on one another, and also as a result of
mass communication, the barriers of the past are greatly reduced.  Today,
because of the complexity of interdependence, every crisis on this planet is
essentially related with every other, like a chain reaction.  Consequently it
is worthwhile taking every crisis as a global one.  Here barriers such as
"this nation" or "that nation", "this continent", or "that continent" are
simply obstacles.  Therefore today, for the future of the human race, it is
more important than ever before that we develop a genuine sense of brotherhood
and sisterhood.  I usually call this a sense of "universal responsibility".

    ...several great Kagyu and Sakya masters...  have expressed the stages [of

from the four forms of clinging."
    First we part from clinging to this life.  Instead of total involvement
with affairs of this life, we involve ourselves with future lives.  We
accomplish this by thinking about our precious human life with all its
freedoms and endowments for spiritual growth, how we lose it because of death
and impermanence, and then the karmic laws of behavioral cause and effect that
shape our future lives.  Next we part from clinging to future lives and
involve ourselves, instead, in the quest for liberation.  By thinking about
all the suffering of uncontrollably recurring rebirth, or samsara, we generate
sincere renunciation of it--the strong determination to be free and attain the
total liberation that is nirvana.

Being the Mirror
    When we say that we have knowledge, or that we have discovered our real
nature and we are in this nature, that means that we are "being the mirror."
You see, "being the mirror" or "looking in the mirror" are two completely
different things.  If we "are the mirror," then we have no concept of
dualistic vision.
    If a reflection manifests in the mirror, why is it manifesting?  There are
two reasons.  One is because the mirror has the capacity to manifest infinite
reflections.  This is the mirror's quality.  If there is an object in front of
the mirror, whose capacity it is to reflect, naturally a reflection will
appear in the mirror.  Furthermore, the mirror has no idea of checking or
accepting the object it is reflecting.  The mirror doesn't need any program
for that.  This is what is called its qualification, or infinite potentiality.
    In the same way, when we have infinite potentiality, but we are ignorant
of our real nature, then we always conceive that "I am here" and "the object
is there," "I am looking and seeing an object," and so on.  We do not discover
that we are like a mirror, and if we never discover this, then of course there
is no way that we can function like the mirror.  When you discover that you
are like the mirror, then there is a possibility that you will be the mirror.
    When you are the mirror, then you have no problems with reflections--they
can be big, small, nice, ugly, any kind.  For you, the reflections are only a
manifestation of your quality, which is like that of a mirror.  When you have
no problems with reflections, then you understand self-liberation.  You are
not changing or transforming something.  You are only being in your real
nature.

    It is important to recognize the difference between an enlightened
experience and the state of enlightenment.  To penetrate the veil is to see
the nature of reality for the first time.  This enlightened experience in the
Zen tradition might be called a satori.  This is a powerful shift of insight
that shakes our reality.  No longer can we live with the delusion we may have
once held.  Our solidly held concepts about reality begin to crumble.  Samsara
shakes, as Lama Yeshe once put it.  This experience may not be comfortable.
To come so close to this existential threshold challenges our secure sense of
identity and can be frightening.  Indeed, as a Tibetan lama once said, this
fear is a sign that we are close to the edge.  We are beginning to recognize
the lack of substance of our ego-identity.  Our "wisdom eye" has opened to a
new truth--an ultimate truth, as opposed to relative truth.
    When we penetrate the veil, however, the work is not yet done.  We may
have had an enlightened experience, but there is further to travel.  As Gen
Jhampa Wangdu once said while I was in retreat, it is not difficult to
experience emptiness; the problem is holding it.  For this insight to have its
full effect, the mind needs to be able to sustain awareness for prolonged
periods of time.  Tibetan teachers will sometimes say we may hit the nail, but
only with a quality of focused attention can we repeatedly do so.  With the
development of tranquil abiding, the veil can be cleared completely in the way
the red ring of fire created by the incense burn[ing] slowly expands and
consumes the entire film of tissue paper.  The mind is gradually cleansed of
the emotional turmoil and confusion that is generated by the misconceptions we
have about reality.

    ...if we see others in trouble, although we cannot immediately take their
suffering upon ourselves, we should make the wish to be able to relieve them
from their misfortunes.  Prayers like this will bear fruit eventually.  Again,
if others have very strong afflictive emotions, we should think, "May all
their emotions be concentrated in me."  With fervent conviction, we should
persist in thinking like this until we have some sign or feeling that we have
been able to take upon ourselves the suffering and emotions of others.  This
might take the form of an increase in our own emotions or of the actual
experience of the suffering and pain of others.
    This is how to bring hardships onto the path in order to free ourselves
from hopes and fears--hopes, for instance, that we will not get ill, or fears
that we might do so.  They will thus be pacified in the equal taste of
happiness and suffering.  Eventually, through the power of Bodhichitta, we
will reach the point where we are free even from the hope of accomplishing
Bodhichitta and the fear of not doing so.  Therefore we should have love for
our enemies and try as much as possible to avoid getting angry with them, or
harbouring any negative thoughts towards them.  We should also try as much as
possible to overcome our biased attachment to family and relatives.  If you
bind a crooked tree to a large wooden stake, it will eventually grow straight.
Up to now, our minds have always been crooked, thinking how we might trick and
mislead people, but this [Bodhichitta] practice, as Geshe Langri Tangpa said,
will make our minds straight and true.

Q: ...what is the nature of the mindstream that reincarnates from lifetime to
lifetime?

A: ...If one understands the term "soul" as a continuum of individuality from
moment to moment, from lifetime to lifetime, then one can say that Buddhism
also accepts a concept of soul; there is a kind of continuum of consciousness.
From that point of view, the debate on whether or not there is a soul becomes
strictly semantic.  However, in the Buddhist doctrine of selflessness, or "no
soul" theory, the understanding is that there is no eternal, unchanging,
abiding, permanent self called "soul."  That is what is being denied in
Buddhism.

Buddhism does not deny the continuum of consciousness.  Because of this, we
find some Tibetan scholars, such as the Sakya master Rendawa, who accept that
there is such a thing as self or soul, the "kangsak ki dak" (Tib. gang zag gi
bdag).  However, the same word, the "kangsak ki dak," the self, or person, or
personal self, or identity, is at the same time denied by many other scholars.

We find diverse opinions, even among Buddhist scholars, as to what exactly the
nature of self is, what exactly that thing or entity is that continues from
one moment to the next moment, from one lifetime to the next lifetime.  Some
try to locate it within the aggregates, the composite of body and mind.  Some
explain it in terms of a designation based on the body and mind composite, and
so on....  One of the divisions of [the "Mind-Only"] school maintains there is
a special continuum of consciousness called alayavijnana which is the
fundamental consciousness.

    In the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path Je Tsongkhapa says that
when we are training ourselves in any of the perfections, for instance in
generosity, we should make sure that we practice all the other five
perfections--in this case ethical discipline, patience, enthusiastic effort,
concentration, and wisdom--and the six excellent factors.  When we perform a
generous action, ethical discipline will be included if we take care to
refrain from doing anything unethical at the same time.  In certain
situations, for instance, we may be tempted to speak harshly or
condescendingly as we give.
    Generosity gives rise to abundance, and by insuring that our practice is
complete, we create the right environment to use these resources
constructively.  Sometimes when we give, people respond ungratefully.  If we
can resist getting upset, we are practicing patience.  Giving not out of a
sense of obligation or reluctantly nor with a wish to outdo others but with
joy is the practice of enthusiastic effort.  Directing our full attention to
an act of generosity is concentration.  Discerning and understanding what is
appropriate to give and what is not, and remembering that the giver, the act
of generosity, and the recipient are all interdependent and empty of inherent
existence are the practice of wisdom.  Including these different factors in
our actions will bring many excellent results such as a good body and mind,
the resources we need, a pleasant appearance, supportive companions, the
ability to complete what we undertake, and the focus not to be distracted by
the disturbing emotions and so forth.  This is how to insure that we will
enjoy many conducive conditions in a future human life.  On the other hand,
our miserliness or impatience now could make us face many difficult
circumstances in the future.

    Shakyamuni Buddha, even when he was a trainee on the path, was solely
concerned in both thought and action with others' welfare.  Whenever he found
an opportunity to work for others, no matter what difficulties he faced, he
was never discouraged.  He never hated obstacles and hardships encountered on
the way.  Instead, the difficult situations facilitated his being more
courageous and determined to accomplish others' welfare.  Just because he was
so determined to work for others in the past, even as a trainee on the path,
it is needless to say how much more it is so with him now as a completely
enlightened person.

When you get tired, it is appropriate to repeat mantra.  However, for a
beginner the main part of the meditation revolves around the six deities*,
which should be cultivated carefully and leisurely.  This is because clear
appearance of oneself as a deity must be achieved for the sake of amassing the
two collections of merit and wisdom, achieving firm meditative stabilisation,
and transforming all physical and verbal actions into powerful aids for
others' welfare.  Hence, before repeating mantra, the yoga of non-dual
profundity (realisation of emptiness) and manifestation (appearance as a
deity) should be sustained, developing clarity in observing the divine form
and in ascertaining its lack of inherent existence.  When, having done this
one-pointedly, you become tired, then for the sake of resting begin repeating
mantra.  ...Tsong-ka-pa also says that in the approximation phase meditation
is chief, mantra repetition is secondary.

There isn't a single one of us who has never felt hostile and angry, so we
know about the effects of anger.  Does it make us feel better or worse?  It
stirs us up, makes us miserable and destroys our tranquillity.  It is quite
easy to recognize anger as a foe and to see how it harms us because its
destructiveness is apparent.  But we find it much harder and are also
reluctant to acknowledge the harm done by attachment because it is a foe
masquerading as a friend.  When desire or attachment first arises, it feels
quite pleasurable but eventually it lands us in trouble.  It wants to possess
what it has fabricated and we reach out for something which, in fact, does not
exist.  Failure to get what we want frustrates us and anger quickly follows.
The third of the poisons, confusion or ignorance, simply stimulates desire and
anger and lies at the root of all the disturbing emotions.

The Sevenfold Cause-and-Effect Method
    If we have been reborn time after time, it is evident that we have needed
many mothers to give birth to us.  ...the first cause bringing about
bodhicitta is the recognition that all beings have been our mother.
    The love and kindness shown us by our mother in this life would be
difficult to repay.  She endured many sleepless nights to care for us when we
were helpless infants.  She fed us and would have willingly sacrificed
everything, including her own life, to spare ours.  As we contemplate her
example of devoted love, we should consider that each and every being
throughout existence has treated us this way.  Each dog, cat, fish, fly, and
human being has at some point in the beginningless past been our mother and
shown us overwhelming love and kindness.  Such a thought should bring about
our appreciation.  This is the second cause of bodhicitta.
    As we envision the present condition of all these beings, we begin to
develop the desire to help them change their lot.  This is the third cause,
and out of it comes the fourth, a feeling of love cherishing all beings.  This
is an attraction toward all beings, similar to what a child feels upon seeing
his or her mother.  This leads us to compassion, which is the fifth cause of
bodhicitta.  Compassion is a wish to separate these suffering beings, our
mothers of the past, from their miserable situation.  At this point we also
experience loving-kindness, a wish that all beings find happiness.  As we
progress through these stages of responsibility, we go from wishing that all
sentient beings find happiness and freedom from suffering to personally
assuming responsibility for helping them enter this state beyond misery.  This
is the final cause.  As we scrutinize how best to help others, we are drawn to
achieving the fully enlightened and omniscient state of Buddhahood.

Among the seven branches [qualities of Buddhahood]--complete enjoyment,
union, great bliss, non-inherent existence, compassion, uninterrupted
continuity, and non-cessation--three are found only in tantra--complete
enjoyment, union, and great bliss--and the other four are common to both
sutra and tantra, although non-inherent existence can also be put in the group
specific to tantra when it is considered as the object ascertained by a bliss
consciousness....  In Yoga Tantras the bliss arising from holding hands or
embracing is used in the path; in Performance Tantras, from laughing; and in
Action Tantras, from looking.  The four tantras are similar in that they all
use desire for the attributes of the desire realm on the path.

    How then does the mistaken idea, that things exist from their own side,
operate?  Whatever appears to the mind appears as if it existed truly from its
own side.  ...Now if the object existed as it appears to you, then, when you
searched for it, you could actually find a real [object].  So, we must ask
ourselves whether or not this object, when searched for, is to be found or
not.  If the object is not found when it is searched for, we must conclude
that it does not exist from its own side, that when the label is applied to
its basis, it is not so labeled because the basis somehow bears within it
something which is the object.  At this point, one must conclude that the
object does not exist as it appears to, but then, one may wonder whether it
exists at all.
    Things, however, are not utterly non-existent.  They do exist nominally.
So things do exist, but they do not exist from the side of the basis of the
label.  And hence, though they do exist, because they do not exist within the
object itself, they must exist only as they are labeled by the subject (the
conceptual mind, for example).  There is no other way for the object to exist
apart from the way it is posited by conceptual thought.  This is then what we
mean when we say that all phenomena are merely labeled by conceptual thought.
However, things do not appear to us as if they were mere conceptually labeled
entities.  Instead, they appear as if they existed from their own side.
Therefore, it is a mistake to think that things exist as they appear.

Meditation is hard work, but it is also the most rewarding thing we can do
with our time.  As we begin to see the mechanisms we previously took for
granted and start to understand them, the knots inside our minds begin to
loosen.  We feel a tremendous sense of freedom, space and release inside us.
As we begin to understand our warped thinking patterns and our neuroses, we
see them directly.  We begin to develop compassion for ourselves, for our pain
and confusion.  Now that we start to look with clarity, we can see the pain
and confusion in the eyes of other people, and we naturally develop compassion
for them.  It doesn't matter how outwardly successful people may appear, we
can see their pain when we look into their eyes.  It is very rare to come
across people whose eyes are truly sparkling with joy.

    ...recognizing that we have certain obligations, and recognizing at the
same time that spiritual practice is the core of a meaningful life, what do we
do?  There really is an answer.  It is not easy, but it is tremendously
fruitful, and it keeps on opening and opening further: transform those actions
that are already obligations by applying Dharma to them.
    Take eating, for instance.  We have to do it two or three times a day, but
we don't have to wolf down the food.  There is no one who cannot sit and pause
first for thirty seconds.  Even fast-food is worth the thirty seconds it takes
to recognize the immense number of beings who have provided us with this food.
Pausing like this ties us into the community of life, at least on planet
earth, as we recognize that we are indebted to others.  We have received, and
as we take the food, let us do it with the aspiration, "May this be returned.
May I use my abilities to the fullest to serve those who have served me."  And
that includes everyone, directly or indirectly.  The service may occur on a
very mundane level, but insofar as we mature spiritually, our responsibility
increases according to our abilities.  Not because someone tells us, "Now you
have to do this," but simply as we gain insight into the nature and sources of
suffering and of contentment, then we have something all the more valuable to
offer others.

The Paramita of Meditative Concentration
    It is said in the Teachings that without taking up the Paramita of
Meditative Concentration, it would be impossible to realize the nature of
mind.  We should think of meditative concentration as the practice that brings
stability to our minds, and creates the good conditions to practice unfocused
meditation--in other words, resting in the uncontrived natural state.
    If we make a quick examination of our own mind, we can see the reason this
kind of stability is so crucial.  Although physics has observed light to be
the fastest traveling phenomenon known to man, actually the speed at which our
minds travel is even faster.  We can circle the globe in a matter of seconds,
and our minds generate doubts, emotions, and conceptual thoughts at a speed
that defies that of all other phenomena.  Because we lack basic mental
stability, conceptual thoughts arise endlessly.  So, if our goal is to realize
the nature of mind, we first have to learn to still our minds, and free
ourselves from distraction.  The method for quieting the mind is called
"meditative concentration."  Once we have gained some initial mind stability,
it is even more important that we continue our training so that this stability
will increase.  Without such stability, it is impossible for us to
successfully learn to abide in the uncontrived view.

5. Your present naked awareness

How amazing!

Your present, naked awareness--
Unspoiled by thoughts of past, present, or future,
Not fettered by mind grasping to so-called "meditation"
Nor falling into a pervasive blankness of so-called "non-meditation"--
The natural state nakedly sustained,
Is the practice of Great Perfection.

Regardless of what thoughts arise during that practice,
To reject negative ones or foster positive ones is unnecessary.
Mere recognition liberates them in their own ground.
Take this liberation upon arising as the path's key point.

Destroy whatever meditative experiences arise, and relax.
A tantric practitioner without fixation is deeply content.
You've reached your goal of contentment right now.
What is the use of numerous enumerations of Buddha's teachings
When you discover Buddha Kuntu Zangpo within yourself?

    The Buddhist view is that in the external world there are some elements
that are material, and some that are nonmaterial.  And the fundamental
substance, the stuff from which the material universe arises, is known as
space particles.  A portion of space is quantized, to use a modern term; it is
particulate, not continuous.  Before the formation of the physical universe as
we know it, there was only space, but it was quantized.  And it was from the
quanta, or particles, in space that the other elements arose.  This accounts
for the physical universe.
    But what brought about that process?  How did it happen?  It is believed
that there existed other conditions, or other influences, which were
nonmaterial, and these were of the nature of awareness.  The actions of
sentient beings in the preceding universe somehow modify, or influence, the
formation of the natural universe.

    ...meditation on emptiness begins with gaining a sense of the inherent
existence of which phenomena are empty, for without understanding what is
negated, you cannot understand its absence, emptiness.
    ...Through carefully watching how you conceive your self, or "I," to be
inherently established, you will determine that the "I" appears to be self-
instituting without depending on the collection of the mental and physical
aggregates, which are its basis of designation, or without depending on any of
them individually, even though the "I" appears with those aggregates.  Proper
identification of this appearance is the first essential toward realizing
selflessness--ascertaining the object of negation.

    At the moment the world's spiritual traditions have greatly degenerated.
It is very important in such times that the practitioners themselves make
especially strong efforts to gain realization.  To permit the lineages of
transmission to disappear is to allow the world to plunge into darkness.  The
great Vasubandhu wrote, "Buddha, who is like the eye of the world, is no
longer to be seen.  His great successors, who realized the most profound
teachings, also have passed away.  Who equals them?"  It might be asked, who
is there today to equal the master Vasubandhu?  Who practices as well as did
Milarepa?  Such people are rare.  We should remember that everything but
Dharma is useless at death, and instead of wasting our lives on meaningless
activities, we should blend our mindstreams with the teachings and with
practice.  Doing so benefits us as individuals and benefits the world by
strengthening its spiritual basis.
    Each of us has to be able to feel the pride that we ourselves can reach
perfection, we ourselves can attain enlightenment.  When even one person
indulges in spiritual practice, it gives encouragement to the guardian spirits
of the land, and to the celestial deities who have sworn to uphold goodness.
These forces then have the ability to release waves of beneficial effects upon
humanity.  Thus our practice has many direct and indirect benefits.  ...If we
practice the teachings and live the ways of Dharma, all the natural forces of
goodness will be behind us.

    Karmic potentials give rise to a broad array of impulses that affect our
lives.  Collective karmic potentials from previous actions of a huge number of
beings--including ourselves--give rise, for example, to the impulse for a
universe to evolve with specific environments and life forms into which we and
these beings subsequently take rebirth.  These collective potentials also give
rise to the impulses that drive the physical and biological laws that govern
that universe--ranging from the weather patterns of its planets to the life-
cycle habits of each species on them.  They also account for the impulses
behind the instinctive daily behavior characteristic of each life form.

    Once the body, channels, and wind are balanced, the next step is to keep
your mind in the natural state through meditation.  By simply maintaining the
mind as it is, without adding or subtracting anything, one will reach the
inner nature, which is unchanging and indestructible.
    The instructions for this type of meditation are very simple.  One begins
by sitting with good posture on a cushion, because it is important to stay
straight.  Then, one simply maintains the natural clarity of the mind, without
analyzing one's experiences or being disturbed by thoughts.  In the dzogchen
style of meditation, there is actually nothing to do except relax in the
mind's nature of clarity and emptiness.  Inner awareness is different than
external awareness; it is called clear-light emptiness.  It is helpful to use
the sky as an analogy for the true nature of the mind--when you let your mind
mingle with the open space of the sky, you do not need any particular focus.
Simply maintain the mind naturally, without discrimination or judgments, and
experience its nature as being spacious as the sky.

    Question: A person, particularly in the West, must have the foundation of
humility, honesty and an ethical way of life.  Once one has this foundation,
what else does Your Holiness suggest that one cultivate in one's life, if
there is the foundation of virtue, ethics and humility?
    DL: The next thing to be cultivated is mental stabilization.  Ethics is a
method to control oneself--it is a defensive action.  Our actual enemy, you
see, is within ourselves.  The afflicted emotions (pride, anger, jealousy) are
our real enemies.  These are the real trouble makers, and they are to be found
within ourselves.  The actual practice of religion consists of fighting
against these inner enemies.
    As in any war, first we must have a defensive action, and in our spiritual
fight against the negative emotions, ethics is our defense.  Knowing that at
first one is not fully prepared for offensive action, we first resort to
defensive action and that means ethics.  But once one has prepared one's
defenses, and has become somewhat accustomed to ethics, then one must launch
one's offensive.  Here our main weapon is wisdom.  This weapon of wisdom is
like a bullet, or maybe even a rocket, and the rocket launcher is mental
stabilization or calm abiding.  In brief, once you have a basis in morality or
ethics, the next step is to train in mental stabilization and eventually in
wisdom.

    4. The power of abandonment.  In this practice what is being abandoned is
self-grasping.  We are reminded again that since beginningless time beyond all
imagination, self-grasping has lain at the very core of all mental distortions
and afflictions.  It has brought us to unfavorable rebirths and is responsible
for all the undesirable circumstances that we encounter.  It is self-
centeredness that obstructs realization and prevents us from deriving the full
benefit from our spiritual practice.  Recognize when self-grasping manifests
in daily life.  It is important to notice it especially at times of passion,
when we are aroused or irritated, and try not to succumb to it for even a
moment.
    To be free of self-centeredness continuously for a whole year may be
difficult, but [rejecting it for] a moment is easy.  ...the more of these
moments we can saturate with the cherishing of others, the more we are molding
ourselves into the bodhisattvas that we will become.

    As a friend, my request and wish is that... you try to promote a sense of
brotherhood and sisterhood.  We must promote compassion and love; this is our
real duty.  Government has too much business to have time for these things.
As private persons we have more time to think along these lines--how to make a
contribution to human society by promoting the development of compassion and a
real sense of community.
    ...If someone who easily gets angry tries to control his or her anger, in
time it can be controlled.  The same is true for a selfish person; first that
person must realize the faults of a selfish motivation and the benefit in
being less selfish.  Having realized this, one trains in it, trying to control
the bad side and develop the good.  As time goes by, such practice can be
effective.  This is the only alternative.
    Without love, human society is in a very difficult state; without love,
in the future we will face tremendous problems.  Love is the center of human
life.

Love and Attachment

People often wonder how to reconcile the Buddha's teachings on non-attachment
with those on love.  How can we love others without being attached to them?
Non-attachment is a balanced state of mind in which we cease overestimating
others' qualities.  By having a more accurate view of others, our unrealistic
expectations fall away, as does our clinging.  This leaves us open to loving
others for who they are, instead of for what they do for us.  Our hearts can
open to care for everyone impartially, wishing everyone to be happy simply
because he or she is a living being.  The feeling of warmth that was
previously reserved for a select few can now be expanded to a great number
of people.

is a very strong feeling.  While some emotions are destructive, others are
constructive.  In a meeting with scientists, we concluded that there are
emotions even in the Buddha's mind.  There is a strong sense of caring and
compassion and also the realization of emptiness.  In the beginning, there is
just a vague feeling of emptiness.  At that level, there is no emotion, but
once you become more familiar with it, then that feeling increases.  At a
certain level, the realization of emptiness also becomes a kind of emotion.
Therefore, in the practice of developing wisdom and loving-kindness
/ compassion, you strengthen these inner qualities and then reach a state
where you have an upsurge of feeling called emotion.  We can clearly see
this link between intellect and emotions.  Thus, the brain and heart can go
side by side.  I think this is the Buddhist approach.

Both mindfulness and discriminative alertness are needed in responding to
sensory input of the three types--attractive, unattractive and neutral.
Once again, in this tradition mindfulness does not mean simply to witness.
It is a more discriminative kind of thing.  You are asking yourself, "What
is my response?" and then actively responding by applying the antidotes to
attachment and hostility.  The word mindfulness is a little bit different in
different contexts.  Here, Mindfulness refers to the mental faculty of being
able to maintain continuity of awareness of an object.  Vigilance is concerned
with the quality of mind, watching to see, for example, if the mind is veering
off to other objects.

    When we say that the ignorant mind is perverse or wrong, we are talking
about the way it misconceives reality.  Now the pertinent questions are: What
is reality?  How is this mind mistaken about reality?  And in what way does
the mind wrongly apprehend reality?  Reality or emptiness of true existence is
something that can be established logically.  There are sound, or perfect,
reasons to prove the emptiness of inherent existence, and we can gain
conviction in these reasons.  On the other hand, there is no logical way to
prove true existence.  True existence is what appears to an ordinary,
untrained consciousness.  But when it comes under logical scrutiny, true
existence cannot be found.  Even in our everyday life we often find
contradictions between the way certain things appear and their actual mode of
existence; that is, the way things actually exist is different from the way
they appear to exist.
    ...Our perception of impermanent things like mountain ranges and houses
does not conform to their actual mode of existence.  Some of these things have
existed for many centuries, even thousands of years.  And our minds perceive
them in just that way--as lasting and permanent, impervious to momentary
change.  Yet when we examine these objects on an atomic level, they
disintegrate every moment; they undergo momentary change.  Science also
describes a similar pattern of change.  These objects appear solid, stable,
and lasting, but in their true nature, they constantly change, not keeping
still even for a moment.

If there is someone who always harms us, and we discover that this person
lives in our own house, we think, "This is too much!"  Once we figure out
that he is causing all our hardships, we kick him out; we do not see it as a
laughing matter at all.  Here, it is worse: we have been wandering in the six
realms of cyclic existence since beginningless time, undergoing great pain and
confusion.  What is the main cause of all this?  Self-centeredness and its
basis, self-grasping ignorance.  These two are right inside us, in our own
mindstream.  How can we continue to tolerate that?  It is just too much!  We
definitely must evict these sources of harm.  When we know the antidotes to
them, we will use them, just as we would go to any length to evict a
troublemaker from our home.  With strong determination, we will find out what
harms self-centeredness and self-grasping and then go ahead and destroy them.

There are many types of meditative stabilisation, but let us explain calm
abiding (samatha) here.  The nature of calm abiding is the one-pointed abiding
on any object without distraction of a mind conjoined with a bliss of physical
and mental pliancy.  If it is supplemented with taking refuge, it is a
Buddhist practice; and if it is supplemented with an aspiration to highest
enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, it is a Mahayana practice.
Its merits are that, if one has achieved calm abiding, one's mind and body are
pervaded by joy and bliss; one can--through the power of its mental and
physical pliancy--set the mind on any virtuous object one chooses; and many
special qualities such as clairvoyance and emanations are attained.

    Apart from the perfection of wisdom,
    All virtuous practices such as
    The perfection of giving are described
    As skillful means by the Victorious Ones.

The first five perfections--giving, ethical discipline, patience, enthusiastic
effort and concentration--as well as meditation on impermanence, on the
connection between actions and their effects and the cultivation of
compassion, love and the altruistic intention are all skillful means.  In fact
all positive practices which do not constitute the cultivation of wisdom fall
into the category of skillful means.

46
    Whoever, under the influence of familiarity
    With skillful means, cultivates wisdom
    Will quickly attain enlightenment--
    Not just by meditating on selflessness.

When stability in practices which develop skillful means has been gained, the
Bodhisattva meditates on the selflessness of persons and other phenomena and
thereby overcomes clinging to their true existence.  This leads swiftly to
enlightenment.  If we confine our efforts only to understanding reality, our
understanding lacks the power to destroy all the obstructions that prevent
omniscience and we may remain locked in a state of solitary peace.
Cultivation of skillful means prevents this and adds such power to our
understanding of reality that, like a blazing fire, it consumes all
obstructions.

The environment where you are doing the meditation should be properly cleaned.
While cleaning, you should cultivate the motivation that since you are engaged
in the task of accumulating great stores of merit by inviting the hosts of
buddhas and bodhisattvas to this environment, it is important to have a clean
place.  You should see that all the external dirt and dust around you is
basically a manifestation of the faults and stains within your own mind.  You
should see that the most important aim is to purge these stains and faults
from within your mind.  Therefore, as you cleanse the environment, think that
you are also purifying your mind.  Develop the very strong thought that by
cleaning this place you are inviting the host of buddhas and bodhisattvas who
are the most supreme merit field, and that you will subsequently engage in a
path that will enable you to purge your mind of the stains of delusions.

    The entire environment we perceive around us arises, in part, in
dependence upon our sense faculties.  The environment we experience does not
truly exist "out there."  Sight is dependent upon visual faculties, hearing
is dependent upon auditory faculties, and tactile sensations depend on nerve
endings.  Psychologically, all that we experience is dependent upon ourselves.
We do not experience anything purely objectively.  The arising and perceiving
of experience is co-emergent between ourselves and the world around us.  Yet,
the deep belief persists that the world really exists "out there" now and eons
before we were born.
    The Buddhist hypothesis extends beyond the psychological.  The Buddhist
hypothesis is this: that which is perceived arises in dependence upon the
perception of it.  Things are empty of independent, inherent existence.  What
appears to exist "out there" is empty of objective existence from its own
side.  This does not mean that nothing exists apart from our perceptions.
Rather, it means that by probing the nature of existence of anything we
experience perceptually or conceptually, we find that nothing exists by its
own independent nature.  Another way of phrasing this is that appearance
extends all the way down to the root and there is nothing beyond the
appearances.  Appearances extend down to quarks; nothing is there purely
objectively and nothing is there purely subjectively.  This is the Buddhist
hypothesis.

    I consider it very important for religion to have an influence on
politicians.  Politicians need religion much more than pious people who have
withdrawn from the world need it.  There is a constant increase in the
scandals in politics and business that can be traced back to the lack of self-
discipline on the part of the responsible parties.  In India, the minister-
president of West Bengal once said to me with what he considered a humble
attitude that he was a politician and not a religious person.  I responded to
him: politicians need religion more than anyone else.
    When hermits in solitude are bad persons, the result is that they harm
themselves alone and no one else.  But when such influential people as
politicians are full of bad intentions, they can bring misfortune to many.
This is why religion, as continuous work on our inner maturity, is important
for political rulers.
    A politician must have moral principles.  I am convinced of this.  Seen in
this light, politics and religion belong together.  In the United States,
church and state may be separate, but when the president takes office, he
makes a vow in the name of God with his hand on the Bible.  This means that
God should be the witness that the president will conscientiously fulfill his
official duties.

...many people, critical of Dzogchen, question why we need to practice at all
if, as according to Dzogchen, the primordial state is already the enlightened
state.  If our true nature is already Buddhahood, what is the need to
cultivate enlightenment?  We cannot side-step these criticisms since,
according to Dzogchen, Buddhahood is indeed our natural state; we do not
create it, but simply discover it through our meditation.  But if we simply
agree with our critics, this would mean there is no need to practice.  These
are important things to think about.  We must answer that although the natural
state of the mind is primordially pure, there are two ways of being pure.
Defilements, or obscurations, are not in the nature of the mind (sems nyid)
but in the moving mind (sems), so they can be purified.  It is as in the
Tibetan story of the old beggar woman who slept on a pillow of gold every
night: she was rich, but since she did not appreciate the value of gold, she
thought she was poor.  In the same way, the primordial purity of our mind is
of no use to us if we are not aware of it and do not integrate it with our
moving mind.  If we realize our innate purity but only integrate with it from
time to time, we are not totally realized.  Being in total integration all the
time is final realization.  But many people prefer thinking and speaking about
integration to actualizing it.

External disarmament is very, very important.  Already, there is some
movement.  My dream is that one day the whole world will be demilitarized, but
we cannot achieve this overnight.  Also, we cannot achieve it without a
proper, systematic plan; however, it is important to make the target clear.
Even though it may take one hundred years, or fifty years, that doesn't
matter.  Establish a clear idea or clear target; then try to achieve it step
by step.  As a first step, we have already started with the elimination of
antipersonnel mines and biological weapons.  Also, we are already reducing
nuclear weapons; eventually, there should be a total ban on nuclear weapons.
This is now foreseeable; the idea of its possibility is approaching.  These
are great, hopeful signs.

    Bare awareness is not easy to develop and maintain because of the mind's
disposition to be constantly preoccupied by thoughts.  We easily lose
attention because our mind is so busy.  When we do, our emotional life can
creep up on us and take us over.  Without mindfulness, the capacity to
maintain attention, disidentification is very difficult, and bare awareness
even more so.  Through meditation it is possible to cultivate a quiet,
unintrusive awareness that greatly strengthens our capacity to remain with our
feelings.  We simply allow their presence without judging them, or needing to
make them different.
    The early stage of meditation focuses attention and cultivates
mindfulness.  Mindfulness is our capacity to watch and remain conscious as
emotions, feelings, and thoughts arise.  We may begin in meditation by
observing the breath and gradually quietening the mind from the constant
discursive chatter that interrupts our attention.  In time a quality of bare
awareness is established free from the conceptual confusion that discriminates
and evaluates what arises and parcels it up in conceptual boxes of good or
bad.  Furthermore, this quiet awareness does not become pulled into the
contents of mental activity and drown in their confusion.

    In the realm of matter, one and the same object can serve as a cause of
happiness for some living beings, and a cause of suffering for others.
Certain plants, for example, function as medicine for some creatures, but for
other species they can be poisonous.  From the point of view of the object
itself there is no difference, but because of the physical constitution and
the material state of the particular living being, that single self-same
object can affect them in different ways.  Then, in the sphere of our own
experiences, the same holds true.  A certain individual may appear to some as
very friendly, kind and gentle, and so gives them feelings of happiness and
pleasure.  Yet to others that same person can appear harmful and wicked, and
so cause them discomfort and unhappiness.
    What this kind of example points to is that, although external matter
may act as a cause for our experience of pain and pleasure, the principal
cause that determines whether we experience happiness or suffering lies
within.  This is the reason why, when Buddha identified the origin of
suffering, he pointed within and not outside, because he knew that the
principal causes of our suffering are our own negative emotions and the
actions they drive us to do.

When you have many excuses not to do your work, ask yourself what guarantee
you have of another chance to do what needs to be done.  Time lost is lost for
good.  No matter how much you promise to improve, no matter what good
intentions you have for making it up, the time is gone for good.  Feeling
sorry about the situation will not bring it back.  You can never buy back that
precious piece of time.  You may think, "Well, that piece of time has passed,
but I still have a long stretch of time left."  No, you do not!  What guarantee
is there that you will have another piece of time like this one?  Wake up and
stop the excuses; they never made sense before and do not make sense now.
Laziness and procrastination have never worked in a sound and helpful way.  It
is only sound and helpful to get things moving.

    Any sense of conceit or self-importance gets in the way of cultivating the
genuine altruistic intention, and the most effective remedy against this is
the cultivation of humility.
    I can tell you a more recent story to illustrate this point.  The great
nineteenth-century Tibetan Dzokchen meditator Dza Patrul Rinpoche always
maintained a demeanour of true humility.  At one time, when he was giving a
series of teachings to a large crowd of students, he experienced a forceful
yearning for solitude.  So one day he quietly left his residence and
disappeared, dressed like an ordinary pilgrim and carrying a walking staff and
very little else.  When he reached a nomadic camp he sought shelter for a few
days with one of the families.  While he was staying with them, his hostess
asked him to read some texts and, since he looked just like an ordinary
pilgrim, in return for his food and lodging she asked him to help with the
household chores, which included the disposal of the contents of her chamber
pot.
    One day, while he was away from the camp attending to this task, some of
his well-dressed monk students came looking for him.  When his hostess heard
their description of him, she suddenly realised this was the same person she
had asked to throw away the contents of her chamber pot.  (It is said she was
so embarrassed that she just ran away!)  Such was the humility of this great
teacher, who had many thousands of students.
    ...great practitioners of the altruistic intention also possess a
tremendous courage grounded in real inner strength....  This combination of a
total lack of conceit yet possessing great depth of courage is what is
required in a true practitioner of bodhicitta, the altruistic mind of
awakening.

Rejoicing in the actions of others is the major antidote to jealousy.  When
we admire the virtuous deeds of ourselves and of others, a great increase of
merit is created.  Jealousy is very harmful, and must be destroyed by
rejoicing.  If we rejoice in the virtue of someone whose understanding is less
than our own, we gain greater merit than that person.  If we rejoice in the
merit of someone with understanding equal to ours, we gain equal merit.  If we
rejoice in the realization or virtue of someone more highly realized than we
are, we accumulate some fraction of the merit that they do.  We must rejoice
in virtue because we have taken bodhisattva vows.  If other beings practice
well it helps us; therefore we should rejoice in their positive actions.  This
is the easiest way to accumulate merit with little hardship.  With consistent
effort the practice of rejoicing becomes very powerful and is greatly praised
by many masters.

    ...there are various factors that contribute to attaining that level of
joy and happiness which we conventionally also recognize as sources of
happiness, such as good physical health, ...the wealth that we accumulate,
...and a circle of friends we trust and with whom we can relate emotionally.
    Now all of these are, in reality, sources of happiness, but in order for
one to be able to fully utilize them with the goal of enjoying a happy and
fulfilled life, one's state of mind is crucial.  If one harbors hateful
thoughts within, or strong or intense anger somewhere deep down, then it ruins
one's health, so it destroys one of the factors.  Even if one has wonderful
possessions, when one is in an intense moment of anger or hatred, one feels
like throwing them--breaking them or throwing them away.  So there is no
guarantee that wealth alone can give one the joy or fulfillment that one
seeks.  Similarly, when one is in an intense state of anger or hatred, even
a very close friend appears somehow "frosty," cold and distant, or quite
annoying.
    What this indicates is that our state of mind is crucial in determining
whether or not we gain joy and happiness.  So leaving aside the perspective of
Dharma practice, even in worldly terms, in terms of our enjoying a happy day-
to-day existence, the greater the level of calmness of our mind, the greater
our peace of mind, and the greater our ability to enjoy a happy and joyful
life.

Question: Is there a buildup of awareness that happens by the practice of
  recognizing or looking for your own basic nature so that, over time, it
  dispels the fear of these emotions?

Rinpoche: Yes, awareness is developed through the discipline of meditation.
  Beginning with shamatha meditation, we develop lots of awareness and
  mindfulness on the path.  Then, in Mahamudra and Dzogchen, we emphasize a
  different aspect of mindfulness and awareness.  Mindfulness and awareness
  come from the discipline of meditation, which continues in our everyday
  life.  Therefore, formal sitting practice is very important for us.  For
  that reason, many teachers tell us to sit at least 10-15 minutes every day.
  That helps us to generate this continuity of awareness in our everyday life.
  There is no easy solution for manifesting awareness or mindfulness in our
  everyday life without some discipline in practice.  The only problem is
  that when a student hears a teacher say that they must sit every day,
  that's the time students usually begin to change their guru!

We ordinary individuals share the characteristic of having our attempts to
gain happiness thwarted by our own destructive self-centeredness.  It is
unsuitable to keep holding onto the self-centered attitude while ignoring
others.  If two friends find themselves floundering in a muddy swamp they
should not ridicule each other, but combine their energies to get out.  Both
ourselves and others are in the same position of wanting happiness and not
wanting suffering, but we are entangled in a web of ignorance that prevents us
from achieving those goals.  Far from regarding it as an "every man for
himself" situation, we should meditate upon the equality of self and others
and the need to be helpful to other beings.

Dalai Lama: "In the traditional [Tibetan] society, most people automatically
did the types of work their families did--nomads, farmers, merchants, and so
on.  But some people still engaged in work that was not in keeping with the
principle of nonharm, because there are butchers, metal smiths who make
swords, and so on.  But these kinds of work were also generally hereditary."

Howard Cutler: "Speaking of work and the implementation of the concept of
nonharm, ...you mentioned that there was a rule in Tibet that any new
invention had to guarantee that it was beneficial or at least not harmful for
at least seven generations."

DL: "...there do seem to be certain practices and policies that successive
Tibetan governments adopted in Tibet that reflect putting into practice
certain Buddhist ideals, such as the Buddhist principle of respecting the
natural world, particularly the animal world.  For example, all the
communities living near the Yamdrok Lake used to rely heavily on fishing in
the past.  Recently I heard about a policy that was adopted during the Fifth
Dalai Lama's time where they were discouraged from fishing, and in order to
compensate them, some other communities would band together and provide them
an equivalent value in grain, so that they would be compensated against their
loss.  Similarly, in the area near Mount Kailash, around Lake Manasarovar
during a particular season, a lot of waterfowl migrate there.  They lay their
eggs on the shores and apparently there was a government policy that during
the egg-laying season, they would appoint people to watch over the eggs to
make sure they were safe.  Of course, there might be individuals who in
addition to taking the salary probably ate some of the eggs as well.  These
things happen.  But overall there is this kind of attitude of nonharm.  "So,
even though in Tibet, people didn't always follow the principle of nonharm in
their work ...this principle was still deeply ingrained in the people.  "In
general, I think this could be applied in the West.  Although not everybody
has options about the work that they do, at least I think it is good to give
serious thought to the kind of work one does, and the impact it has on others.
I think it is best to choose work that does not cause harm to others, that
does not exploit or deceive others, either directly or indirectly.  I think
that's the best way."

    If we are feeling very nervous all the time, the first step toward doing
something to remedy the situation is to take ourselves and the quality of our
life seriously.  Suppose we are walking down the street and we step on a bug
and partially crush but have not actually killed it.  If we continue walking
and ignore the bug's experience of its leg being crushed or severed, we do so
because we do not take the insect and its life seriously.  We have no respect
for it.  If we treat ourselves no better than we do a bug and ignore our
innermost pains and anguish, that is most unfortunate.
    Taking ourselves seriously means actually looking at how we are
experiencing our life and, if there is something unsatisfactory about it,
admitting it to ourselves.  Our tension and stress do not go away by denying
them or avoiding taking an honest look.  And admitting that something is amiss
is not the same as complaining about it and feeling sorry for ourselves.  Nor
does it imply that something is fundamentally wrong with us and we are guilty
of being a bad person because we are nervous.  Being objective, not
melodramatic, and remaining non-judgmental are essential for any healing,
spiritual process.

Wouldn't life be boring without attachment?

    No.  In fact it's attachment that makes us restless and prevents us from
enjoying things.  For example, suppose we're attached to chocolate cake.  Even
while we're eating it, we're not tasting it and enjoying it completely.  We're
usually either criticizing ourselves for eating something fattening, comparing
the taste of this chocolate cake to other cakes we've eaten in the past, or
planning how to get another piece.  In any case, we're not really experiencing
the chocolate cake in the present.
    On the other hand, without attachment, we can think clearly about whether
we want to eat the cake, and if we decide to, we can eat it peacefully,
tasting and enjoying every bite without craving for more or being dissatisfied
because it isn't as good as we expected.  As we diminish our attachment, life
becomes more interesting because we're able to open up to what's happening in
each moment.

Question: When a practitioner of the Great Vehicle vows not to enter into
nirvana until all beings are liberated, how is it possible to fulfill this
vow?

Answer: Three modes of generating an altruistic intention to become
enlightened are described--like a king, like a boatman, and like a shepherd.
In the first, that like a king, one first seeks to attain a high state after
which help can be given to others.  In the second, like a boatman, one seeks
to cross the river of suffering together with others.  In the third, like a
shepherd, one seeks to relieve the flock of suffering beings from pain first,
oneself following afterward.  These are indications of the style of the
altruistic motivation for becoming enlightened; in actual fact, there is no
way that a Bodhisattva either would want to or could delay achieving full
enlightenment.  As much as the motivation to help others increases, so much
closer does one approach Buddhahood.

    A bodhisattva is someone who says from the depth of his or her heart, "I
want to be liberated and find ways to overcome all the problems of the world.
I want to help all my fellow beings to do likewise.  I long to attain the
highest state of everlasting peace and happiness, in which all suffering has
ceased, and I want to do so for myself and for all sentient beings."
According to the Buddha's teaching, anyone who makes this firm and heartfelt
commitment is a bodhisattva.  We become bodhisattvas from the moment we have
this vast and open heart, called bodhichitta, the mind bent on bringing
lasting happiness to all sentient beings.
    Buddhist literature defines three types of bodhisattvas: the kinglike
bodhisattva, the captainlike bodhisattva, and the shepherdlike bodhisattva.  A
kinglike bodhisattva is like a good king who first wants everything luxurious
for himself, like a big palace, a large entourage, a beautiful queen, and so
on.  But once his happiness has been achieved, he also wants to help and
support his subjects as much as possible.  Accordingly, a kinglike bodhisattva
has the motivation, "First, I want to free myself from samsara and attain
perfect enlightenment.  As soon as I have reached buddhahood, I will help all
other sentient beings to become buddhas as well."
    A captainlike bodhisattva would say, "I would like to become a buddha, and
I will take all other sentient beings along with me so that we reach
enlightenment together."  This is just as the captain of a ship crosses the
sea, he takes his passengers with him, and they reach the far shore
simultaneously.
    A shepherdlike bodhisattva is inspired by thinking, "I want to help all
sentient beings to reach enlightenment and see the truth.  Only when this is
achieved and samsara is emptied will I become a buddha myself."  In actual
fact it may not happen this way, but anyone who has this motivation is called
a "shepherdlike bodhisattva."  In the old days, sheep were not kept in fenced
pastures, and the shepherds had to bring them down from the mountains to
protect them from wolves.  They would follow behind the sheep, guiding them
into their pen and lock them in.  A shepherd would take care of his sheep
first, and only then would he go home and eat.
    The bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara developed this shepherdlike motivation and
is therefore considered to be the most courageous and compassionate of beings.
He vowed, "I will not attain complete enlightenment until I have led all
sentient beings to liberation without leaving a single one behind."

    The practice of compassion begins at home.  We have our parents, our
children, and our brothers and sisters, who perhaps irritate us the most, and
we begin our practice of loving-kindness and compassion with them.  Then
gradually we extend our compassion out into our greater community, our
country, neighbouring countries, the world, and finally to all sentient beings
equally without exception.
    Extending compassion in this way makes it evident that it is not very easy
to instantly have compassion for "all sentient beings."  Theoretically it may
be comfortable to have compassion for "all sentient beings," but through our
practice we realize that "all sentient beings" is a collection of individuals.
When we actually try to generate compassion for each and every individual, it
becomes much more challenging.  But if we cannot work with one individual,
then how can we work with all sentient beings?  Therefore it is important for
us to reflect more practically, to work with compassion for individuals and
then extend that compassion further.

It wouldn't be bad if you didn't have statues, but it has become indispensable
to have Buddhist texts which deal with the structured path to train our mind.
If you have Buddhist texts, read them for yourselves and to friends who visit.
That way you can help others to understand Buddhist ideas.  For instance, it
is interesting to read Milarepa's life story and songs.  We find in them many
enlightening lessons.  Buddha's image alone will not purify us of karmic
obscuration....  It is very important to study the scriptures.  They are not
to be just stacked up on the altar.  They must be cultivated in our mind.
...[we] take great interest in having the symbolic representations of Buddha's
body, speech and mind.  I feel it is more important to acquire and read
scriptures, the symbolic representations of his speech.  You can pay homage to
them, you can make offerings to them; above all, you should study them.

From the Buddhist point of view, being in a depressed state, in a state of
discouragement, is seen as a kind of extreme that can clearly be an obstacle
to taking the steps necessary to accomplish one's goals.  A state of self-
hatred is even far more extreme than simply being discouraged, and this can be
very, very dangerous.  For those engaged in Buddhist practice, the antidote to
self-hatred would be to reflect upon the fact that all beings, including
oneself, have Buddha Nature--the seed or potential for perfection, full
Enlightenment--no matter how weak or poor or deprived one's present situation
may be.  So those people involved in Buddhist practice who suffer from self-
hatred or self-loathing should avoid contemplating the suffering nature of
existence or the underlying unsatisfactory nature of existence, and instead
they should concentrate more on the positive aspects of one's existence, such
as appreciating the tremendous potential that lies within oneself as a human
being.  And by reflecting upon these opportunities and potentials, they will
be able to increase their sense of worth and confidence in themselves.

An instruction that matches examples and their meanings to show how the
absolute nature permeates everything.  (*SG)

These various examples give a general idea of the absolute nature.  (*DK)

...there are four examples and their meanings.  Take the example of a
Sugata's body: whichever way one looks at it, it is beautiful.  (*Z)

Similarly, everything a realized being does, since it is permeated with the
realization of the unborn nature, is bliss, for he does not have ordinary
attachment and aversion.  (*Z & SG)

Whether one looks at a Sugata's face or any other part of his body, one never
feels one has looked enough.  It is an example of ultimate beauty.  Similarly,
those for whom everything is backed by the realization of the unborn nature no
longer have ordinary attachment and aversion, and such persons can therefore
act like enlightened beings: whatever they do is bliss.  Since they have fully
realized the absolute nature, there is no question of telling them, "This is
the right thing to do; that is something you should not do."  They have no
concepts or limits, so they can act as they wish.  Everything they do will be
nothing but bliss.  (DK)

The initial period of deity yoga is called prior approximation because one is
accustoming to a deity through becoming closer and closer to its state,
whereupon the deity grants the feat, either directly or in the sense of
bestowing a capacity to the mind.  Actually effecting the achievement of feats
is done by way of carrying out prescribed burnt offerings or repetition of
mantra, etc., after the approximation has been completed.  These feats are
then used for the welfare of others in the third stage, which involves
activities of (1) pacification such as overcoming plague or relieving others
of demons, (2) increase of lifespan, intelligence, wealth, and so forth, (3)
control of resources, persons harmful to others' welfare, etc., and (4)
ferocity, such as expelling or confusing harmful beings.

The bodhisattva, as the personification of individuation, discovers a unique
capacity to awaken his or her potential to work for the welfare of others in
whichever way most suits his or her individual disposition.  When I consider
my own teachers, one thing I particularly value is their capacity to be
authentically themselves.  They each have their unique personality and quality
that is a genuine expression of their individuality.  There is no
contradiction between our Western need to be individuals and the Buddhist
path.  Buddhism does not demand that we become clones of some ideal.  Rather,
it asks us to respond to who we are and awaken our full potential, expressing
it within our particular individual capacity.  My Tibetan teachers have
supremely individualistic personalities, something I love and value deeply.
They respond to me as an individual with my own personality, which they would
never ask me to relinquish.  The fact that they were each on their own unique
journey within the Buddhist path was, for me, a sublime example of the
bodhisattva as an individuated person who has truly responded to the inner
call to awaken.

The view is to believe in and understand the buddha nature, the essence of all
the buddhas.  If one knows the buddha nature, then that is to know the
unchanging essence which is free from any limitation, the original primordial
nature of the mind as it is.  This is not like a light bulb that suddenly
comes on or something that is newly acquired.  It is the nature as it has
always been and always will be: primordially perfect.  To recognize the buddha
nature is the view.  To fail to recognize the buddha nature is to deviate into
confusion.  If you recognize your buddha nature, this is the same as having an
audience with all the buddhas.  You will meet face to face with all your root
teachers.

    ...when we ask, what is the substantial cause of the material universe way
back in the early history of the universe, we trace it back to the space
particles which transform into the elements of this manifest universe.  And
then we can ask whether those space particles have an ultimate beginning.  The
answer is no.  They are beginningless.  Where other philosophical systems
maintain that the original cause was God, Buddha suggested the alternative
that there aren't any ultimate causes.  The world is beginningless.  Then the
question would be: Why is it beginningless?  And the answer is, it is just
nature.  There is no reason.  Matter is just matter.
    Now we have a problem: What accounts for the evolution of the universe as
we know it?  What accounts for the loose particles in space forming into the
universe that is apparent to us?  Why did it go through orderly processes of
change?  Buddhists would say there is a condition which makes it possible, and
we speak of that condition as the awareness of sentient beings.

Q: Certain associates can say things to me that spark an aggressive reaction.
Why is it so easy to spark this feeling of negativity if there is not an
accumulation of energy behind it?

A: This is because of your pattern of clinging to the idea that you should
have all the good things, and nothing that bothers you should ever happen, as
I explained earlier.  This is wishful thinking, because the nature of the
world is not like that at all.  The ego game you have planned is itself the
explanation for how easily your anger is sparked.  Because you have planned
such a delicate, impossible game, and there are many things that can happen,
anything that jeopardizes the plan of your ego upsets you.  It is not an
accumulation of energy but the pattern of clinging that is at fault.

    Suppose...  you try to convert someone from another religion to the
Buddhist religion, and you argue with them trying to convince them of the
inferiority of their position.  And suppose you do not succeed, suppose they
do not become Buddhist.  On the one hand, you have failed in your task, and on
the other hand, you may have weakened the trust they have in their own
religion, so that they may come to doubt their own faith.  What have you
accomplished by all this?  It is of no use.  When we come into contact with
the followers of different religions, we should not argue.  Instead, we should
advise them to follow their own beliefs as sincerely and as truthfully as
possible.  For if they do so, they will no doubt reap certain benefits.  Of
this there is no doubt.  Even in the immediate future, they will be able to
achieve more happiness and more satisfaction.
    ...When I meet the followers of different religions, I always praise them,
for it is enough, it is sufficient, that they are following the moral
teachings that are emphasized in every religion.  It is enough, as I mentioned
earlier, that they are trying to become better human beings.  This in itself
is very good and worthy of praise.

    Only a Buddha has extinguished all faults and gained all attainments.
Therefore, one should mentally go for refuge to a Buddha, praise him with
speech, and respect him physically.  One should enter the teaching of such a
being.
    A Buddha's abandonment of defects is of three types: good, complete, and
irreversible.  Good abandonment involves overcoming obstructions through their
antidotes, not just through withdrawing from those activities.  Complete
abandonment is not trifling, forsaking only some afflictions or just the
manifest afflictions, but forsaking all obstructions.  Irreversible
abandonment overcomes the seeds of afflictions and other obstructions in such
a way that defects will never arise again, even when conditions favourable to
them are present.

In commenting on the first instruction spoken by Manjushri, we considered the
question of attachment to this lifetime and the faults that come from this
attachment.  However, the question of attachment goes deeper.  It is not just
a matter of giving up attachment to this life's rewards but of losing our
taste and affinity for the whole of worldly existence.  This is why it is
necessary to contemplate and meditate upon the faults of conditioned
existence.  Otherwise, we may imagine that samsara possesses any manner of
attractive qualities.  Pondering the shortcomings of samsara should bring
forth in us a tangible sense of disgust, as we are confronted with our own
misguided pursuit of worldly ends.

    Another problem we face today is the gap between rich and poor.  In this
great country of America, your forefathers established the concepts of
democracy, freedom, liberty, equality, and equal opportunity for every
citizen.  These are provided for by your wonderful Constitution.  However, the
number of billionaires in this country is increasing while the poor remain
poor, in some cases getting even poorer.  This is very unfortunate.  On the
global level as well, we see rich nations and poor ones.  This is also very
unfortunate.  It is not just morally wrong, but practically it is a source of
unrest and trouble that will eventually find its way to our door.
    ...one of my elder brothers, who is no longer alive, would tell me of his
experiences living in America.  He lived a humble life and told me of the
troubles, the fears, the killings, theft, and rape that people endured.  These
are, I think, the result of economic inequality in society.  It is only
natural that difficulties arise if we must fight day by day in order to
survive while another human being, equal to us, is effortlessly living a
luxurious life.  This is an unhealthy situation; as a result, even the
wealthy--the billionaires and millionaires--remain in constant anxiety.  I
therefore think that this huge gap between rich and poor is very unfortunate.
    ...So, for those of you who are poor, those who come from difficult
situations, I strongly urge you to work hard, with self-confidence, to make
use of your opportunities.  The richer people should be more caring toward the
poorer ones, and the poor should make every effort, with self-confidence.

Not to be busy
    Tibetans say that once upon a time all the yaks that live in Tibet were
living in India as water buffalo.  It was very, very hot in India so some of
them decided if they were to keep walking to the north they would get to a
place that would be nice and cool.  So they climbed up in the mountains, and
as they were climbing their hair started to grow.  Because of this the water
buffalo in India often turn their head and look out expectantly and they are
waiting for their brothers who have wandered off.  In a similar way at one
time all the buffalo of samsara and nirvana were living together and one day
some of them wandered off and came into samsara.  They keep looking around to
see who else is there and where the other half is, because the basic quality
of our ordinary sense of self is that it is very lonely.  Something is missing
in our lives and we don't quite know what it is, but we keep looking and
looking to find this missing part.  We can look for it in terms of
possessions, we can look for it in terms of the form of our body, trying to
change it through dieting or hair style or whatever.  You can look in terms of
friends.  Anything.  And this keeps us very, very busy.  Sometimes the
busyness can be very exhausting, but when we stop then we feel lonely.  So we
get busy again.  Dharma is very helpful here if you want distraction because
there are many kinds of ways to be busy in the dharma.  You can focus on
having lots of dharma possessions.  You can focus on learning the text by
heart, on the mantras and mudras, on serving the tsog, on doing meditations.
There is always something to be busy with.
    In Tibet many, many people practiced dharma but not so many seem to get
enlightened.  There are many kinds of dharma and if we practice in a way that
doesn't focus on the essential point but on secondary and tertiary levels it
is easy to get lost.  It is really important, given that we have limited time,
to focus on what is essential.  Many people when they get a plate of food will
eat the things they don't like so much first and leave the special thing to
the end.  But when when we apply this to life we can make a big mistake.  The
time for deep practice is now.  You can learn all about Padmasambhava and what
his clothes mean and what his hair style means but if you don't know the
nature of your own mind then knowledge about Padmasambhava is just some more
concepts.

What is undistracted calm abiding?  It is meditative absorption free of the
six types of distraction.  What are these six?

    (1) Inherent distraction refers to the eye consciousness and the other
four collections of consciousness.  Because they are naturally directed
outward, they [cause one to] emerge from meditative absorption.
    (2) External distraction refers to a mental consciousness that reaches out
towards or engages objects.
    (3) Internal distraction concerns dullness and agitation, as well as
savoring one's meditative absorption.
    (4) The distraction of marks occurs when, trusting in meditative
absorption, one apprehends marks of it and becomes attached.
    (5) Distraction brought about by negative tendencies is when directing the
mind involves the apprehending of an ego.  This is said to refer to the mental
act of pridefully believing oneself to be superior to others, or [simply any
mental act] that involves apprehending an "I".
    (6) The distraction of directing the mind occurs when one is caught up in
the mindset of, and directs the mind in the style of, the Lesser Vehicle.

The undistracted calm abiding that is determined by the elimination of
those six is the unique calm abiding of the Great Vehicle.  This is a state of
one-pointed inner rest, a flawless calm abiding.  In it, there is no
apprehension of marks, as is the case when inner absorption alone is believed
to bring liberation.  Neither does it involve the ego apprehension that occurs
in the concentrations of non-Buddhists.  Further, one does not direct the mind
as one would when cultivating the supports for the inferior paths [to
liberation].  This is how the wise should understand the calm abiding of the
Great Vehicle.

    Calm abiding is predominantly stabilizing meditation, in which the mind is
kept on a single object, rather than analytical meditation, in which a topic
such as impermanence or emptiness is analyzed with reasoning.  The purpose of
developing calm abiding is that, since a mind that is scattered to external
objects is relatively powerless, the mind needs to be concentrated in order to
become powerful.  If you do not have concentration in which the mind is
unfluctuatingly stable and clear, the faculty of wisdom cannot know its
object, just as it is, in all its subtleties.  Therefore, it is necessary to
have a highly focused mind.
    ...In order to set the mind steadily on an object of observation, it is
necessary initially to use an object of observation suited to counteracting
your own predominant afflictive emotion, since its force remains with your
mind now and can easily interrupt any attempt to concentrate the mind.
Therefore, Buddha described many types of objects for purifying behavior:
    + For someone whose predominant afflictive emotion is desire, ugliness is
a helpful object of meditation.  Here, "ugliness" does not necessarily refer
to distorted forms; the very nature of our body--composed of blood, flesh,
bone, and so forth--might seem superficially to be very beautiful with a good
color, solid and yet soft to touch, but when it is investigated, you see that
its essence is quite different--substances like bone, blood, urine, feces,
and so forth.
    + For someone who has predominantly engaged in hatred, the object of
meditation is love.
    + For someone who was predominantly sunk in obscuration, the meditation is
on the twelve links of the dependent-arising of cyclic existence because
contemplating its complexity promotes intelligence.
    + For someone whose predominant afflictive emotion is pride, the
meditation could be on the divisions of the constituents because, when
meditating on the many divisions, you get to the point where you realize that
there are many things you do not know, thereby lessening an inflated sense of
yourself.
    + Those dominated by conceptuality can observe the exhalation and
inhalation of the breath because, by tying the mind to the breath,
discursiveness diminishes.
    A particularly helpful object for all personality types is a Buddha body,
since concentration on a Buddha's body causes your mind to mix with virtuous
qualities.  No matter what the object is, this is not a case of meditating
within, looking at an external object with your eyes, but of causing an image
of it to appear to the mental consciousness.

...an understanding of the doctrine of emptiness is fundamental to tantric
practice.  Every sadhana begins with, is structured around, and ends with
meditation upon emptiness.  To practice Vajrayana without the wisdom of
emptiness can be very dangerous.  For example, a main tantric technique is the
cultivation of a subtle divine pride, a confidence that one is an enlightened
tantric deity, the Lord of the Mandala.  One's mind is the Wisdom Body of a
Buddha, one's speech is the Beatific Body, one's form is the Perfect Emanation
Body, and the world and its inhabitants are seen as a mandala inhabited by the
various forms of tantric deities.  Thus we have to utterly change our sense of
"I."  To do so involves the subject of emptiness.  To practice the yoga of
divine pride without an understanding of emptiness will not only be useless,
but could lead to identity problems and other undesirable psychological
effects.  Therefore it is said that although the Vajrayana is a quick path
when correctly practiced on the proper spiritual basis, it is dangerous for
the spiritually immature.  This type of danger area is one of the reasons why
the Vajrayana must be practiced under the supervision of a qualified vajra
acharya.

    Self-discipline brings us into relationship with one of the six
perfections of the bodhisattva, that of enthusiastic perseverance, which
implies the willingness to engage in a process with effort and enthusiasm over
a prolonged period.  No material or spiritual qualities are gained without
some degree of effort.  Perseverance enables the practitioner to carry on and
trust in the process, even when it feels hopeless.  It makes it possible to
face difficulties and obstacles in the path with confidence and courage,
rather than giving up because it feels too hard.  Self-discipline helps us
remain in the vessel and not run away.
    My Tibetan retreat guide described the maintenance of self-discipline over
time like keeping a pot heating on a stove.  If we continually remove it from
the heat the pot never boils.  Similarly he felt that when someone enters into
the discipline of retreat, it should be maintained as rigorously as possible.
In doing so the alchemical vessel will be maintained, and the "cooking" can
take place.  Transformation only occurs when the vessel is maintained in this
way.

Compassion without attachment is possible.  Therefore, we need to clarify the
distinctions between compassion and attachment.  True compassion is not just
an emotional response but a firm commitment founded on reason.  Because of
this firm foundation, a truly compassionate attitude toward others does not
change even if they behave negatively.  Genuine compassion is based not on our
own projections and expectations, but rather on the needs of the other:
irrespective of whether another person is a close friend or an enemy, as long
as that person wishes for peace and happiness and wishes to overcome
suffering, then on that basis we develop genuine concern for their problem.
This is genuine compassion.  For a Buddhist practitioner, the goal is to
develop this genuine compassion, this genuine wish for the well-being of
another, in fact for every living being throughout the universe.

    Buddha traveled and taught widely for some forty-five years after his
enlightenment, and his audiences were diverse.  Even though India at the time
was a highly literate society, nothing of what he said was written down during
his lifetime.  Instead, various individuals were entrusted with memorizing the
gist of each discourse.  The work of transcribing his words took place only
with the passage of generations.
    Tibetans believe that this reluctance on the part of the Buddha and his
immediate followers to commit the enlightenment teachings to paper, and
instead to preserve them as oral traditions, was a purposeful strategy gauged
to maintain the maximum fluidity and living power of the enlightenment
experience.  It only became necessary to write things down when the darkness
of the changing times threatened the very survival of the legacy.  An oral
tradition becomes lost to history should its holders pass away without first
passing on their lineages.
    This intended fluidity, and the according safeguard against the
establishment of an "enlightenment dogma" is perhaps best demonstrated by a
verse that the Buddha himself said shortly before his death:
        Do not accept any of my words on faith,
        Believing them just because I said them.
        Be like an analyst buying gold, who cuts, burns,
        And critically examines his product for authenticity.
        Only accept what passes the test
        By proving useful and beneficial in your life.
    This simple statement empowered future generations of Buddhist teachers to
accept and reject at will anything said by Buddha himself as well by his early
disciples.  If something that was said by them did not pass the test of
personal analysis, one could simply discard it as being limited in application
to particular times, people, or situations, and therefore as only contextually
valid.

the power of guns--the Soviet Union, China, Burma, the Philippines, many
communist countries, countries in Africa and South America.  But eventually,
you see, the power of guns and the power of the will of ordinary human beings
will change places.  I am always telling people that our century is very
important historically for the planet.  There is a big competition between
world peace and world war, between the force of mind and the force of
materialism, between democracy and totalitarianism.  And now within this
century, the force of peace is gaining the upper hand.  Still, of course, the
material force is very strong, but there is a kind of dissatisfaction about
materialism and a realization or feeling that something is missing.

An inexpressible, self-arisen expanse
Without the names "samsara" and "nirvana."

    Here, "self-arisen" means the primordial state.  It is not something we
can fully express with words or concepts.  It's beyond words or concepts.  The
nature of all is not biased; it is not restricted to one or another.  The
nature of all exists in one identical state.  That ground, that nature, does
not have any name such as samsara or nirvana.  That is the foundation, that is
the ground.  It is beyond samsara and nirvana.  Not knowing the ground means
wandering in samsara.  If you recognize this ground, if you truly experience
this ground, buddhahood is attained.  That is the fruition.  That is the
result of our practice and our path.
    ...The ground, that fundamental state of simplicity, is the origin of all
elaborations.  This pure basic state is like a simple artist's canvas.  We
paint different images on this canvas.  We can paint the image of a buddha,
and it becomes very pure, beautiful, and inspiring to look at.  We can also
paint a devil on the same canvas, which can create our fundamental suffering,
our basic pain.  However, the basis of both is the same simple state of canvas
that is completely pure and totally free from the images we project on it.  It
is totally free, whether that image is a buddha or a devil.  That is the

Setting a Specific Intention for Our Practice
    We should think about how we can make the best use of our practice so that
we get the most out of it in the short time we have in this life.  We do not
have the leisure of wasting our time here by delaying the benefits of our
practice.  We have to use these situations as effectively as we can.
    Before you begin any practice, first think very carefully about your
motivation.  When we are engaged in the threefold process of study,
contemplation and meditation, we should be very specific, very clear about why
we are doing it.  We should remind ourselves, "I am doing this to transcend my
negative emotions and my ego-clinging."  This is a general example of a
specific intention.  However, to be more precise, we need to consider the
unique make-up of our own individual kleshas [intense states of suffering, and
ignorance].  Once we have identified our strongest emotion, then we can focus
on the practices that will alleviate it.  We begin with whichever emotion is
strongest for us and then we move on to the next strongest, followed by the
next, and so on.
    It is important for us to prioritize our practice in this way.  We have
to keep our intention very clear in all three phases--in our study, in our
contemplation and in our meditation.  During shamatha or other practices, when
thoughts come up, we recall that our purpose is to overcome our disturbing
emotions and kleshas.  We have to have a sense of willpower or determination
in our minds.  In order for the remedy to work, we must tell ourselves, "Yes,
I am going to transcend this anger.  I am going to work with it."  Otherwise,
if we do not have a clear idea, if we simply sit there with an indefinite or
vague intention, then the effect also will be vague.  We may have sat for one
hour and although that time will not have been wasted, because it was not
directed in an intentional way, the experience will not be so sharp, to the
point or effective.

    ...particularly in Buddhism while we practice we must use the brain as
well as the heart.  On the ethical side, we must practice the quality of a
good and warm heart; also, since Buddhism is very much involved in reasoning
and logic--the wisdom side--intelligence is important.  Thus, a combination of
mind and heart is needed.  Without knowledge, without fully utilized
intelligence, you cannot reach the depths of the Buddhist doctrine; it is
difficult to achieve concrete or fully qualified wisdom.  There may be
exceptions, but this is the general rule.
    It is necessary to have a combination of hearing, thinking, and
meditating.  The Kadampa teacher Dromton ('brom ston pa, 1004-1064) said,
"When I engage in hearing, I also make effort at thinking and meditating.
When I engage in thinking, I also search out more hearing and engage in
meditation.  And when I meditate, I don't give up hearing and don't give up
thinking."  He said, "I am a balanced Kadampa," meaning that he maintained a
balance of hearing, thinking, and meditating.

If through listening to this explanation of the Seven Point Mind Training we
come to recognise how important Bodhichitta is, this will be an infallible
cause of our enlightenment.  Of all the eighty four thousand different
sections of the doctrine, the precious Bodhichitta is the very essence.  By
hearing the words of such a teaching, it is impossible even for demons, whose
nature it is to kill and to do harm, not to have positive thoughts!  Kham, a
region in East Tibet, was haunted in the past by many ghosts and evil spirits,
and this was one of the reasons why Patrul Rinpoche used to explain the
Bodhicharyavatara continually to his disciples.  Before long, there were no
more ghosts--or at least, no one came to any more harm.  Such is the hidden
power of Bodhichitta!

    Sometimes we face certain situations where, although we have done
something good for others, we may not be able to reap the consequences within
this lifetime.  When we are talking about the law of causality, we are not
limiting its operation to the confines of this life alone, but rather are
taking into account both this lifetime and the future.  Occasionally people
who do not have a proper knowledge of karmic law say that such and such a
person is very kind and religious and so forth, but he always has problems,
whereas so and so is very deceptive and negative, frequently indulging in
negative actions, but always seems very successful.  Such people may think
that there is no karmic law at all.  There are others who go to the other
extreme and become superstitious, thinking that when someone experiences
illness, it is all due to harmful spirits....  It is also possible for very
negative people to experience their positive karma ripening immaturely due to
the very strong force of negative actions, and thus to exhaust the potentials
of their virtuous actions.  They experience a relative success in this life,
while others who are very serious practitioners, as a result of the force of
their practices, bring upon this lifetime the consequences of karmic actions
which might have otherwise thrown them into rebirth in lower realms of
existence in the future.  As a result, they experience more problems and
illnesses in this life.
    Just resolving not to indulge in a negative action is not enough.  It
should be accompanied by the understanding that it is for your own benefit and
sake that you must live with awareness of the law of karma: if you have
accumulated the causes, you will have to face the consequences; if you desire
a particular effect, you can work to produce its causes; and if you do not
desire a certain consequence, you can avoid engaging in actions that will
bring it about.  You should reflect upon the law of causality as follows: that
there is a definite relation between causes and effects; that actions not
committed will never produce an effect; and that once committed, actions will
never lose their potentiality simply through the passage of time.  So, if you
wish to enjoy desirable fruits, you should work for the accumulation of the
appropriate causes, and if you want to avoid undesirable consequences, you
should not accumulate their causes....  [Karma] is a natural law like any
other natural law.

    Generally speaking, there are two forms of meditation on emptiness.  One
is the space-like meditation on emptiness, which is characterised by the total
absence or negation of inherent existence.  The other is called the illusion-
like meditation on emptiness.  The space-like meditation must come first,
because without the realisation of the total absence of inherent existence,
the illusion-like perception or understanding will not occur.
    For the illusion-like understanding of all phenomena to occur, there needs
to be a composite of both the perception or appearance and the negation, so
that when we perceive the world and engage with it we can view all things and
events as resembling illusions.  We will recognise that although things appear
to us, they are devoid of objective, independent, intrinsic existence.  This
is how the illusion-like understanding arises.  The author of the "Eight
Verses for Training the Mind" indicates the experiential result when he
writes: "May I, recognising all things as illusion, devoid of clinging, be
released from bondage."
    When we speak of cultivating the illusion-like understanding of the nature
of reality, we need to bear in mind the different interpretations of the term
'illusion-like'....  For example, the Buddhist realist schools explain the
nature of reality to be illusion-like in the sense that, although we tend to
perceive things as having permanence, in reality they are changing moment by
moment and it is this that gives them an illusion-like character.

    Actually, we are all part of the community of humanity.  If humanity is
happy, has a successful life, a happy future, automatically, I will benefit.
If humanity suffers, I too will suffer.  Humanity is like one body, and we are
part of that body.  Once you realize this, once you cultivate this kind of
attitude, you can bring about a change in your way of thinking.  A sense of
caring, commitment, discipline, oneness with humanity--these are very relevant
in today's world.  I call this secular ethics, and this is the first level to
counter negative emotions.
    The second level in this connection is taught by all major religious
traditions, whether Christian or Muslim or Jewish or Hindu.  They all carry
the message of love, compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, contentment, and
discipline.  These are countermeasures for negative emotions.  When anger is
about to surface, when hatred is about to flare up, think of tolerance.  It is
important to stop any mental dissatisfaction when we feel it because it leads
to anger and hatred.
    Patience is the countermeasure for mental dissatisfaction.  Greed and its
self-centeredness bring unhappiness, and also destruction of the environment,
exploitation of others, and increases the gap between the rich and the poor.
The countermeasure is contentment.  So practicing contentment is useful in our
daily lives.
    ...All religious traditions talk about methods of compassion and
forgiveness.  If we accept religion, we should take the religious methods
seriously and sincerely and use them in our daily lives.  Then, a meaningful
life can develop.

    Actually, if we look around, people whom we don't like and people who harm
us are in the minority.  Let's say we're at work, at a social gathering, or at
a Dharma center with thirty people.  How many of them do we really dislike?
We may have problems with a few people here and there, but we manage to stay
in a room together, don't we?  It's not like we despise them and they hate us.
The number of people we can't stand in this world is actually very small.
These people are rare.  To practice patience we need the people that we don't
like.  We can't practice patience with our friends or with people who are kind
to us.  Finding people that we don't like or who threaten us is not so easy.
So, when we finally find them, they are a precious treasure!  They are rare to
find.  When we meet them, we can think, "Fantastic, I get to practice patience
now."
    They say that high-level bodhisattvas pray to meet disgusting,
uncooperative people because they want to practice patience.  Of course, when
you really want to meet obnoxious people, they don't show up!  Why don't they
turn up for high-level bodhisattvas?  Because high-level bodhisattvas don't
have any anger.  We could be sitting in a room with many people whom we
consider unbearable, but high-level bodhisattvas don't see them that way at
all.  To them, these people appear lovable.  Bodhisattvas have such a hard
time finding detestable people, whereas we come across them so easily!  So,
when we find people whom we don't like, feel threatened by, or find
despicable, we should recognize that there aren't so many of them around.
Therefore, we should cherish them and take the opportunity to practice
patience with them.

...to have greater self-awareness or understanding means to have a better
grasp of reality.  Now, the opposite of reality is to project onto yourself
qualities that are not there, ascribe to yourself characteristics in contrast
to what is actually the case.  For example, when you have a distorted view of
yourself, such as through excessive pride or arrogance, because of these
states of mind, you have an exaggerated sense of your qualities and personal
abilities.  Your view of your own abilities goes far beyond your actual
abilities.  On the other hand, when you have low self-esteem, then you
underestimate your actual qualities and abilities.  You belittle yourself, you
put yourself down.  This leads to a complete loss of faith in yourself.  So
excess--both in terms of exaggeration and devaluation--are equally
destructive.  lt is by addressing these obstacles and by constantly examining
your personal character, qualities, and abilities, that you can learn to have
greater self-understanding.  This is the way to become more self-aware.

Phowa is a practice which should be done repeatedly, all through our lives so
that we can do it naturally and purposefully at the time of death.  I have
heard a story about a Tibetan who was dying and his family called the lama to
be with him.  The lama sat beside him and told him to think only of his root
guru and forget everything else.  He said, "I can't recall my guru, I can only
think of a sizzling sausage being warmed in the ashes of a fire."  The lama was
very skillful: "That is excellent!" he said.  "Dewachen, the paradise of the
Amitaba Buddha, is full of sausages; they grow on every tree.  You only have
to open your mouth and you will have all the sausages you want.  The color of
Amitaba is like the embers of a fire, so think of him and you will go to his
realm."  It is said that the man went straight to the pure land of Dewachen.

"Yogis should at all times avoid fish, meat, and so forth,
should eat with moderation, and avoid foods that are not
conducive to health."  --Kamalashila

    Meditators need to be physically healthy.  Therefore, proper diet is
essential.  On the other hand, their minds should be clear and strong and this
will also contribute to physical health.  For these reasons, it is recommended
that they give up eating fish, meat, garlic, onions, etc.  Appropriate food
should be eaten in moderation, for indigestion can cause havoc with
meditation.  What's more, those who overeat can hardly stay awake.
    ...If a vegetarian diet does not result in protein deficiency, it is a
wholesome way of living.  Even if you cannot be a strict vegetarian, at least
moderating the amount of meat you eat is beneficial.  Within the southern
schools of Buddhism eating meat is not strictly prohibited, but the meat of
certain animals, such as those that are not cloven-hoofed or those that have
been slaughtered specifically for your consumption, is forbidden.  This means
that meat bought casually in the market is acceptable....  However, certain
scriptures... strictly prohibit eating meat at all times, whereas other
scriptures... seem to permit it.

It would be wrong to say, as some do, that if we don't recite prayers while
being aware of their meaning and merely repeat the words mindlessly, it has no
benefit whatsoever--like prayer flags flapping in the wind.  However, there
are indeed differences in the level of benefits and blessings derived from
prayers according to the way we recite them.  Therefore, keeping this in mind,
at the beginning of the practice, generate bodhicitta.  During the main
practice, some will use an object of concentration and some will practice
without an object of concentration; each person should do what is best
according to their level.  At the end, one should dedicate the merit in a way
that is pure from the three conceptual spheres to the best of one's ability.
The most important and essential thing in making [prayer] meaningful is to
depend on those three stages of practice--generation of bodhicitta, the main
practice and dedication of merit.  All must do the complete three stages of
practice.

  "When the thought of the internal

  Has perished, grasping ceases

  When actions and afflictions cease, there is liberation;
  They arise from false conceptions, these arise
  From the elaborations [of false views on inherent
  Existence]; elaborations cease in emptiness."
    -- Nagarjuna

Inherent existence has never been validly known to exist; therefore, it is
impossible for there to be any phenomenon that exists through its own power.
Since it is experienced that mere dependent-arisings, which are in fact empty
of inherent existence, do cause all forms of help and harm, these are
established as existent.  Thus, mere dependent-arisings do exist.  Therefore,
all phenomena exist in the manner of appearing as varieties of dependent-
arisings.  They appear this way without passing beyond the sphere or condition
of having just this nature of being utterly non-inherently existent.
Therefore, all phenomena have two entities: one entity that is its superficial
mode of appearance and one entity that is its deep mode of being.  These two
are called respectively conventional truths and ultimate truths.

The cloistered environment stands in stark contrast to the uncontrolled
environment of everyday active life in the modern world.  When I was a
graduate student living in a family housing unit at Stanford University, I
meditated early in the morning.  At about 7:00 outside our window, a group of
little girls would begin shrieking and driving their plastic tractors and
tricycles across the bricks.  I was meditating and these girls were disturbing
my peace.  I got to feeling pretty sorry for myself so I phoned my lama,
Gyatrul Rinpoche, and asked for advice.  He gave me a one-liner, "Just view
it."  This was not just Rinpoche's way of telling me to quit whining, but a
reminder of the more encompassing teaching to embrace obstacles in practice.
And carry on.  We can't always control our environment, but we can embrace it,
the good, the bad, and the loud, and integrate it into Dharma practice.

    If we have been reborn time after time, it is evident that we have needed
many mothers to give birth to us....  the first cause bringing about
bodhicitta is the recognition that all beings have been our mother.
    The love and kindness shown us by our mother in this life would be
difficult to repay.  She endured many sleepless nights to care for us when we
were helpless infants.  She fed us and would have willingly sacrificed
everything, including her own life, to spare ours.  As we contemplate her
example of devoted love, we should consider that each and every being
throughout existence has treated us this way.  Each dog, cat, fish, fly, and
human being has at some point in the beginningless past been our mother and
shown us overwhelming love and kindness.  Such a thought should bring about
our appreciation.
    ...if all other sentient beings who have been kind to us since
beginningless time are suffering, how can we devote ourselves to pursuing
merely our own happiness?  To seek our own happiness in spite of the suffering
others are experiencing is tragically unfortunate.  Therefore, it is clear
that we must try to free all sentient beings from suffering.

3.2.4 The way in which experiences dawn through practicing [Mahamudra]

In beginners, this is similar to water [gushing down] a gorge.
In between, it is the gentle flow of the river Ganga.
Finally, all waters meet like a mother and her child.    -- Tilopa

    The meditative equipoise of beginners entails intense movement of
thoughts, similar to water gushing down a narrow gorge.  The reason for this
is as follows.  Though there is some slight resting in equipoise, thoughts
proliferate.  Right at that point, through the remedy of alertness and by
considering that you like resting in meditative concentration and dislike not
resting in it, you rest in meditative equipoise again.  Through such an
approach, your mind becomes somewhat uplifted.
    The meditative equipoise of those who have attained a little bit more
stability than that and are of middling faculties is similar to the gentle
flow of the river Ganga.  The reason is as follows.  Even if some thoughts
come up, a little here and there, their own face is immediately recognized, so
that the movement of thoughts does not run wild.  Without various notions that
chase after these [subtle thoughts] or any physical and mental effort, all
thoughts that come up will dawn slowly.  There is also no need to make great
effort in [applying] their remedies.  Rather, these happen naturally or of
their own accord.
    Finally, in the meditative equipoise of those with highest faculties,
neither thoughts to be relinquished arise nor is there any need to newly
create some remedial wisdom, because there is nothing to be relinquished.
Since existence and peace have become one taste, mother and child luminosity
blend, or, expanse and wisdom have become indifferentiable.  Once the
tributary waters and the ocean have become one taste, like a mother and her
child meeting, they cannot be disturbed.

    The theory of interdependence allows us to develop a wider perspective.
With wider mind, there is less attachment to destructive emotions like anger,
therefore more forgiveness.  In today's world, every nation is heavily
interdependent, interconnected.  Under these circumstances, destroying your
enemy--your neighbor--means destroying yourself in the long run.  You need
your neighbor.  More prosperity in your neighbor, you'll get the benefit.
    Now, we're not talking about the complete removal of feelings like anger,
attachment, or pride.  Just reduction.  Interdependence is important because
it is not a mere concept; it can actually help reduce the suffering caused by
these destructive emotions.
    We can say the theory of interdependence is an understanding of reality.
We understand that our future depends on global well-being.  Having this
viewpoint reduces narrow-mindedness.  With narrow mind, one is more likely to
develop attachment, hatred.  I think this is the best thing about the theory
of interdependence--it is an explanation of the law of nature.  It affects
profoundly, for example, the environment.
  -- His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Victor Chan, "The Wisdom of Forgiveness:
     Intimate Conversations and Journeys"
~
The Suffering of Change
    Feelings of suffering change into those of happiness.  Feelings of
happiness change into suffering.  Both arise in dependence upon internal and
external causes which change.  For example, we see food as pleasurable, but if
we eat too much, then it causes suffering.  When we are young, we see our
bodies as a source of pleasure.  As we become older, the same body becomes a
source of suffering.
    Just as a wave is always changing, so the nature of suffering is always to
change.  It may be experienced as pleasure or as suffering, but it arises from
the same source.  Pleasure arises from suffering.  Seeing pleasure as
happiness constitutes suffering.
    ...Pain and pleasure are of the same nature.  Although they look different
at different times, they both arise from the same sea of delusion and karmic
action.  Pleasure or pain, one or the other, arises and then falls back into
the ocean.  Thus we can conclude that pleasure and pain within the ocean of
samsara are basically suffering, and dissolve into suffering.
    This becomes evident in the wide variety of sudden changes of experience
depicted in films.  Love and hatred, happiness and family strife, peace and
war, follow each other in rapid succession.  The continuous change, although
exaggerated in films, is characteristic of life in general.

    We feel money and power can bring happiness and solve problems, but they
are not definite causes of those desired states.  If that were so, it would
follow that those who have wealth would necessarily have happiness, and those
who do not have wealth would always experience suffering.  Money and power
facilitate, but it is clear that they are not the primary causes of, happiness
and solving our problems.  It is justified for us to make material and
financial development for building our nation and providing shelter, etc. for
ourselves; we need to do that.  But we also need to seek inner development.
As we can see, there are many people who have wealth and power who remain
unhappy, due to which their health declines, and they are always taking
medicines.  On the other hand, we find people who live like beggars but who
always remain peaceful and happy.
    Therefore, in our daily life a certain way of thinking makes us happy, and
a certain way of thinking makes us unhappy.  In other words, there are certain
states of mind which bring us problems, and they can be removed; we need to
make an effort in that direction.  Likewise, there are certain states of mind
that bring us peace and happiness, and we need to cultivate and enhance them.

Focusing the Mind on the Deity

    Those with superior mental capacity should refine their ability by
practicing the development stage without any sense of clinging or fixation.
In this approach, the appearance of the deity and its ornaments are visualized
in such a way that they are totally complete, vivid, and distinct from the
very beginning.  This is the form of great wisdom, the union of development
and completion.  Beyond being an identifiable entity with a precise nature, it
appears clearly yet is devoid of any essence.  In other words, clarity and
emptiness are indivisible.  Like the reflection of the moon in a lake, its
very nature is to appear in a distinct manner, down to the pupils of the eyes,
while in reality it is empty.
    Those with moderate mental capacity should begin their meditation with a
sudden recollection of the deity's complete appearance.  The next step is to
meditate on the clear appearance of the head, and, once this is stable, to
then meditate progressively on the right arm, left arm, torso, right and left
legs, and finally on the complete form of the deity and its seat.  Training in
the development stage of illusory clear appearance keeps one from straying
into the view of nihilism.  When one grows weary of this, the practitioner
should recollect purity and refine his or her ability in the essence of this
process, the vajra-like absorption.  This key point keeps one from straying
into the belief in permanence.
    For beginners with less mental capacity, it may be difficult to visualize
in either of these ways.  When not yet familiar with this process, one's
ability should be refined using a permanent form.  Take a consecrated and
well-formed representation of the yidam deity, such as a painting or clay
statue made by a skilled artisan, and place it before you.  Without
intentionally meditating, look directly at it from top to bottom without
blinking.  This is referred to as the auxiliary practice of setting
mindfulness into motion.  At first, the agitated movement of conditioned
thought patterns will be experienced.  This is the experience of movement,
which is said to be "like water cascading off a cliff."

    The reason why we find so much discussion of epistemology, or how to
define something as a valid cognition, in Buddhist writings is because all our
problems, suffering and confusion derive from a misconceived way of perceiving
things.  This explains why it is so important for a practitioner to determine
whether a cognitive event is a misconception or true knowledge.  For it is
only by generating insight which sees through delusion that we can become
liberated.
    Even in our own experience we can see how our state of mind passes through
different stages, eventually leading to a state of true knowledge.  For
instance, our initial attitude or standpoint on any given topic might be a
very hardened misconception, thinking and grasping at a totally mistaken
notion.  But when that strong grasping at the wrong notion is countered with
reasoning, it can then turn into a kind of lingering doubt, an uncertainty
where we wonder: "Maybe it is the case, but then again maybe it is not".  That
would represent a second stage.  When further exposed to reason or evidence,
this doubt of ours can turn into an assumption, tending towards the right
decision.  However, it is still just a presumption, just a belief.  When that
belief is yet further exposed to reason and reflection, eventually we could
arrive at what is called 'inference generated through a reasoning process'.
Yet that inference remains conceptual, and it is not a direct knowledge of the
object.  Finally, when we have developed this inference and constantly
familiarized ourselves with it, it could turn into an intuitive and direct
realization--a direct experience of the event.  So we can see through our own
experience how our mind, as a result of being exposed to reason and
reflection, goes through different stages, eventually leading to a direct
experience of a phenomenon or event.

Not recognizing their own face, but letting them run wild, one thought leads
to many kinds of [other] thoughts.  If you fall into letting this continue,
you wander around in confusion.  Through directly looking at the face of
whatever thought that comes up at the very start [of a potential train of
thought], without being able to stand its own ground, just like a rainbow
fading away in space, this thought vanishes into emptiness.  Since you arrive
at such within the previous experience of stillness, if you become familiar
with it, the stream of confusion is severed through thoughts coming to rest on
their own and vanishing on their own.  Hence, if you know how to sustain this,
even if you regard movement as a flaw and [try to] stop it, you need neither
stop it nor [apply] any other remedy for the movement of thoughts.  Rather, by
sustaining the state of realizing their own essence, you realize the essential
point that all the various appearances of happiness and suffering emerge from
the mind and dissolve back into the mind.  Through this, you realize the
essential point that all of cyclic existence and nirvana is produced by the
mind, the mind resting naturally settled without being affected by thoughts
about the three times.

Question: Western religions use the term "God", and Buddhism does not.  Could
emptiness or nirvana be considered God?  If the afflictive obstruction that is
the conception of inherent existence is eliminated, does one realize that
everything is God?

Dalai Lama: If God is interpreted as an ultimate reality or truth, then
selflessness may be considered as God and even as a creator in the sense that
within the nature of emptiness things appear and disappear.  In this sense,
emptiness is the basis of everything; because of emptiness, things can change,
and things can appear and disappear.  Thus, voidness--emptiness,
selflessness--is this kind of basis.

Immeasurable Joy

    Because such love and compassion have not arisen in their mindstreams,
people don't understand that all sentient beings are their kind mothers.  They
hold on to them as friends or foes, and the power of bad karmic action causes
them to experience the immeasurable suffering of cyclic existence.  "Wouldn't
it be a joy if I could carry the suffering of those mothers, and if all beings
could have all of my happiness and virtue?  In order to establish these
mothers in happiness, what a joy it would be if, until cyclic existence is
empty, their suffering and the cause and effect of suffering, their sins and
the cause and effect of sins, would all ripen in me and these mothers would
become abundantly happy.  I give my body, enjoyments, power, prestige, and
roots of virtue in all times for the sake of these mothers.  I won't pursue my
own peace and happiness for even a moment.  I will work for the welfare of
beings without regard for life or limb.  These mothers must have the entire
range of happiness and the causes of happiness."  With that thought, meditate
on joy.
    "Furthermore, I will not shrink away from the specific harm done to
sentient beings, or any kind of sickness, suffering, misfortune, enemies, and
obstructions that happen to me for their sakes.  What a joy if all the
suffering of beings ripened in me, so that I would have that kind of
suffering.  And even a greater joy when those suffering beings are free of
suffering and dwell in exceptional happiness."
    Generate an extraordinary attitude with that thinking.  It is important
that such joy does not stray into any kind of bias.  And if you know it all to
be like a dream or an illusion, free of fixation to true existence, it is
called immeasurable joy.

Question: What should you say to a loved one who is talking about a third
person with hatred or anger?  On the one hand, you want to show compassion for
the feelings being experienced by the loved one.  On the other hand, you don't
want to reinforce or lend approval to that hatred.  What might one say?

Dalai Lama: Here I would like to tell a story.  Once there was a Kadampa
master called Gampowa who had many responsibilities.  One day he complained to
the Kadampa master Dromtonpa that he had hardly any time for his meditation or
for his Dharma practice.  So Dromtonpa responded by agreeing with him, "Yes,
that's right.  I don't have any time either."  Then once an immediate affinity
was established, Dromtonpa skillfully said, "But, you know what I am doing is
for the service of the Dharma.  Therefore, I feel satisfied."  Similarly, if
you find one of your beloved ones speaking against someone out of anger or
hatred, maybe your initial reaction should be one of agreement and sympathy.
Then once you have gained the person's confidence, you can say, "But...."

    ...if you have not purified ordinary appearances into emptiness, how could
you possibly meditate on the mandala circle?  The fact that all phenomena are
emptiness, that samsara and nirvana are inseparable, is the very reason we are
able to actualize this by meditating on the mandala circle.  In other words,
emptiness is the basis for the development stage.  As it is said, "For the one
to whom emptiness is possible, anything is possible."  If all phenomena were
not empty and ordinary appearances were truly present, development stage
meditation would be impossible, as the following quotation points out: "Even
though one might empower wheat to be rice, rice won't actually appear."
However, even if all phenomena are realized to be empty in this way, without
the momentum of great compassion you will not be able to manifest the
rupakayas to benefit others.  This is similar to the listeners and solitary
buddhas, who enter into a state of cessation and do not benefit others with
rupakaya emanations.
    Once one understands this point, it will be like the following saying:
"All these phenomena are like an illusion and birth is like taking a stroll
in a park...."  Said differently, one will no longer dwell in existence, while
through compassion, one will not get caught up in a state of peace either.
This is the great, universal path of the offspring of the victorious ones.
For all these reasons, making sure the three absorptions are not isolated from
one another is a vitally important point.

    We can experience things without confusion and without being tense.  Even
the most disturbed, nervous person has moments of clarity and calmness--even
if only when he or she is peacefully asleep and dreaming pleasant or innocuous
dreams.  This demonstrates that confusion and tension are not integral parts
of the nature of mind.  Thus confusion can be removed.  Not only can it be
removed, but since confusion cannot be validated and can be totally replaced
by understanding, which can be verified, confusion can be eliminated forever.
Thus it is possible for a total absence of confusion to exist.  Furthermore,
since confusion limits mind from using its full potentials, once confusion is
gone, a utilization of all potentials can also exist.  Therefore, since we all
have a mind, and all minds have the same nature of being able to experience
whatever exists, we can all realize and experience the definitive Three
Precious Gems.
    Thus, if we aim to remove our confusion and realize our potentials as
indicated by the Buddhas, their achievement, their teachings, what they have
built up along the path and those who are progressing along it, we are
traveling through life with a safe, reliable and positive direction.  Taking
refuge, then, means to put this realistic, safe direction in our life.
Without it, our practice of mahamudra either has no direction and leads
nowhere, or an unsound direction leading to more confusion and trouble.  In
addition, the further we travel in this safe direction through the mahamudra
techniques--in other words, the more we realize the nature of mind and its
relation to reality--the more confident we become in the soundness of this
direction and our ability to reach its goal.  The stronger our confidence, the
further we progress along the path.

    The Rolling Stones have a song that goes,
        "Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
        Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day."
That is the level that we have to reach, where wild horses cannot drag us
away from the present moment of awareness.  Once we have reached that level of
training, then even in the bardos of death we will be able to guide our mind
steadily past all difficulties toward awakening, toward freedom from samsara.
    There is another well-known image; it compares our wild minds to a mad
elephant in a china shop.  When untamed, this elephant can very easily destroy
many things in the shop, and even the shop itself.  With one move, the
elephant can destroy a wall; and with another move, another wall.  In only
four moves, this elephant can destroy the whole structure.  In the same way,
if our minds are not tamed, they can easily destroy our whole collection of
virtue--all the merit and wisdom we have accumulated through the
accomplishment of countless positive deeds.
    Vipashyana meditation is the process of taming and training our minds.
How do we do it?  We catch our minds with shamatha and we train them with
vipashyana.  Then we ride our minds with mindfulness while remaining aware of
the greater environment.  Following these methods, we will reach our goal
quite quickly--especially when we remember the thought of impermanence, which
works like a whip.

    It is possible to understand the Buddhist teachings as a method of
psychological healing, comparable to psychotherapy, that teaches us how we can
master destructive forces like anger, envy, and greed.  Human beings seem to
be a bundle of different qualities and psychological processes.  We should
attentively examine our qualities and be alertly aware of our experiences in
order to recognize what we truly feel and think.  At the same time, the
personality of human beings is not seen as a unified whole.  According to
these teachings, the heart of consciousness is composed of various elements,
the five types of attachment, or skandhas: body, sensations, perceptions,
instinctual forces, and consciousness.
    These inner forces impart the false concept of an ego-consciousness.  The
basic problem of emotional disorders therefore lies in a false concept of
identity.  This I-blindness should therefore be abolished through self-
study....  The goal is not self-realization but selflessness.

Life would be unbearable if everything stayed the same because human beings
find situations that are fixed and predictable very hard to tolerate.  Even in
small matters, we become uneasy if we feel there is no end in sight.  I know
of couples who live harmoniously together for ten years then marry and are
divorced within a year.  As soon as they feel bound to each other for the rest
of their lives, they begin to fight.  Impermanence removes our reasons for
quarrelling with each other.  Arguments only break out if we imagine that our
relationships are endless.  When we appreciate that our time with our
families, partners, and friends may be shorter than we think, we get on better
with each other.  Awareness of impermanence gives us extraordinary inner
strength and resilience.

    The ability to look at events from different perspectives can be very
helpful.  Then, practicing this, one can use certain experiences, certain
tragedies, to develop a calmness of mind.  One must realize that every
phenomenon, every event, has different aspects.  Everything is of a relative
nature.  For example, in my own case, I lost my country.  From that viewpoint,
it is very tragic--and there are even worse things.  There's a lot of
destruction happening in our country.  That's a very negative thing.  But if I
look at the same event from another angle, I realize that as a refugee, I have
another perspective.  As a refugee there is no need for formalities, ceremony,
protocol.  If everything were status quo, if things were okay, then on a lot
of occasions you merely go through the motions; you pretend.  But when you are
passing through desperate situations, there's no time to pretend.  So from
that angle, this tragic experience has been very useful to me.  Also, being a
refugee creates a lot of new opportunities for meeting with many people.
People from different religious traditions, from different walks of life,
those whom I may not have met had I remained in my country.  So in that sense
it's been very, very useful.
    It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow.  All
of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have
a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties.  This
can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can make the problem seem very
intense.  When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider
perspective can definitely help--realizing, for instance, that there are many
other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse
experiences.  This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in
certain illnesses or when in pain.  At the time the pain arises it is of
course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices
to calm the mind.  But if you can make comparisons, view your situation from a
different perspective, somehow something happens.  If you only look at that
one event, then it appears bigger and bigger.  If you focus too closely, too
intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable.  But if you
compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem
from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming.

     Happiness: A Handbook for Living"

Three Forms of Compassion

    Chandrakirti explained three types of compassion: compassion aimed at
suffering, aimed at phenomena, and unaimed.  With the first, we look at
animate beings in light of their suffering and develop the wish for them to be
free from both that suffering and its causes.  One source of their suffering
is their unawareness that they even have any problems, let alone their not
knowing the causes of their problems.  For example, our friend becomes upset
at the slightest thing that goes wrong and sees this as normal.  He or she
does not understand that hypersensitivity is to blame and that something can
be done to remedy this.  When we see this sad situation, our compassion for
our friend becomes even stronger.
    Compassion aimed at phenomena looks at beings in light of their moment-to-
moment changes.  With it, we wish others to be free of suffering and its
causes based on the understanding that these both are impermanent.  We also
see that others are unaware of this fact and so, when depressed, for example,
they make their sufferings worse by imagining that they will last forever.
Realizing this further enhances compassion for them.
    Unaimed compassion looks at beings in terms of their voidness.  It has the
same wish as the other two forms, but is based on not identifying others
concretely with their suffering.  Seeing that others do not have this insight
and that consequently they identify themselves with their problems intensifies
our compassion for them even more.

Don't be confused; the point of Scrum and XP and other agile methodologies is
the same point behind any management technique of the past 100 years--squeeze
every drop of work out of your workers until they are empty husks and can be
thrown away.  If you're a programmer and you think Scrum is going to "empower"
you, you could not be more mistaken.  Management will hide behind the
principles of Scrum when it suits them and then still do whatever they want
otherwise.  When it's pointed out to them that they're violating the agile
principles, they will simply claim that this is how the system is tailored
for our company's "needs" and that we shouldn't blindly follow it.  But if you
need to break with an agile practice, oh no, the process is *God* and we must
follow it to the exact letter.

A Song on Impermanence

With this spouse and these near and dear ones you desire to live together,
Inseparable for all times, but there is no doubt that you will be separated.

From this excellent home you would like to be inseparable forever
And take root in it, but you will surely depart.

From this happiness, well-being, and wealth you want to be inseparable forever
So you can relish them, but it is certain you will lose them.

From this supreme human body with its freedoms and riches you wish to be
  inseparable
And own it until the end of times, but there is no way that you won't die.

From this really great teacher you yearn to be inseparable
And listen to the dharma for all eternity, but there is no question that you
  will be separated.

From these good friends you wish to be inseparable forever
So you can hang out together, but it's a sure thing that you will be parted.

Therefore, from today on, don your armor of vigor--
The time has come to travel to the land of inseparable great bliss.
You friends who have developed weariness from the depths of your hearts,
I, a dharma-beggar, request you to do so.

    The wisdom that realizes emptiness, that has gained insight into the
nature of reality, is of varying kinds, depending upon the level of subtlety
of the consciousness perceiving the emptiness.  In general, there are rough
levels of consciousness, more subtle levels, and then the innermost subtle
level of consciousness.  It is the uncommon characteristic of Tantric practice
that through it one can evoke this most subtle consciousness at will and put
it to use in a most effective way.  For example, when emptiness is realized by
this subtlest level of mind, it is more powerful, having a much greater effect
on the personality.
    In order to activate or make use of the more subtle levels of
consciousness, it is necessary to block the rougher levels--the rougher or
grosser levels must cease.  It is through specifically Tantric practices, such
as the meditations on the chakras and the channels, that one can control and
temporarily abandon the rougher levels of consciousness.  When these become
suppressed, the subtler levels of consciousness become active.  And it is
through the use of the subtlest level of consciousness that the most powerful
spiritual realizations can come about.  Hence, it is through the Tantric
practice involving the most subtle consciousness that the goal of
enlightenment can most quickly be realized.

By building up good habits of the mind in meditation, our behavior in daily
life gradually changes.  Our anger decreases, we are better able to make
decisions, and we become less dissatisfied and restless.  These results of
meditation can be experienced now.  But we should always try to have a broader
and more encompassing motivation to meditate than just our own present
happiness.  If we generate the motivation to meditate in order to make
preparation for future lives, to attain liberation from the cycle of
constantly recurring problems, or to reach the state of full enlightenment for
the benefit of all beings, then naturally our minds will also be peaceful now.
In addition, we'll be able to attain those high and noble goals.

    ...all four tantra sets make use of deity yoga, the special tantric means
for amassing the collections of merit and wisdom quickly.  Highest Yoga Tantra
has, in addition, techniques for generating subtler minds that realise
emptiness and for using the winds or currents of energy that are the mounts of
these subtler minds as the substantial cause of an actual divine body.
Through this enhancement of the wisdom consciousness the obstructions to
omniscience are quickly removed and Buddhahood is attained.
    In the three lower tantras--Action, Performance, and Yoga--deity yoga is
used to bring about the speedy achievement of many common feats and to come
directly under the care of Buddhas and high Bodhisattvas, receiving their
blessings, and so forth.  This is done through a threefold process known as
prior approximation, effecting the achievement of feats, and using the feats
in the performance of activities for the welfare of others.

If you are able to think about the meaning of cyclic existence in general and
human life in particular, then it is possible to discipline the mind through
religious practice which is the process of becoming peaceful and anxiety-free.
Otherwise, if too much emphasis is put on the sufferings of the hells and the
imminence of death, there is a chance of falling into paralysing fear.  There
is a story in Tibet about an abbot of a monastery who went to give a
discourse.  A fellow asked the abbot's servant where the abbot had gone, and
the servant said, "He has gone to frighten old men and women."  If you fulfil
the value of a human lifetime through engaging in religious practice, then
there is no point in worrying about death.

...if a fire which consumes
One house moves to another,
It is right to throw out anything
Like straw which could ignite.

Likewise anything to which the mind
Is attached ignites the fire of anger.
Fearing our merit will be consumed,
It should be discarded at once.

  If a house is on fire and the fire is spreading, we need to clear away straw,
wood or anything else which is highly flammable and could cause a conflagration
that would consume our entire home and property.  Similarly, one way to prevent
desire and attachment is to avoid contact with the objects that stimulate it.
If anything comes between us and what we desire or if the thing to which we're
attached is harmed or threatened, we instantly feel angry.  This destroys the
positive energy we've created.
  Another way is not to avoid the objects but to contemplate their unappealing
aspects, because desire results from focusing only on their attractive side.
The third way is to contemplate their lack of true existence, since desire and
clinging are based on seeing them as very real and objectively existent.
Whichever technique we employ, the aim is to prevent desire and attachment,
since they bring many other problems.

    Usually when we breathe, we breathe in and, as soon as we have finished
breathing in, we immediately start breathing out.  And as soon as we have
finished breathing out, we start breathing in again.  There is never any space
or gap in between the in-breath and the out-breath.  Now, many different ways
of focusing the mind on the breathing have been taught....  There are
basically six methods taught in the abhidharma.  But here we have something
different from any of those.  This is called gentle threefold breathing.  It
is called gentle because there is no particular attempt to manipulate the
breathing, except that instead of breathing in and then immediately breathing
out, after breathing in, you wait before you breathe out...here the duration
of the inhalation, of the retention, and of the exhalation should all be
equal, three equal periods within each complete breath.
    In doing this, some people combine the phases of the breath with the
mental repetition of the three mantra syllables: OM AH HUM (HUNG)--OM
coordinated with the in-breath, AH with the retention of the breath, and HUM
(HUNG) with the out-breath.  But what is most important here is simply to
recollect, as they occur, the inhalation, retention, and exhalation, so that,
while you are inhaling, you are aware that you are doing so; while you are
retaining the breath, you are aware that you are doing so; and while you are
exhaling, you are aware that you are doing so.  In the beginning, it is
recommended that beginners start with doing, for example, twenty-one of these
breaths as a series, and it is important to practice with enough mindfulness
so that, while you breathe in, and so forth, you maintain an awareness of what
part of the breathing process you are in.

  ...though the emptiness of an impure phenomenon and the emptiness of a
pure phenomenon are the same, there is a difference.  What is the difference?
The continuum of an impure substratum will later cease, not existing in
Buddhahood, whereas a pure substratum's continuum of similar type will exist
right through Buddhahood.  Since the deity as whom you are imaginatively
meditating yourself is a divine figure that exists in the state of Buddhahood
when all defilements have been abandoned, this substratum is, for your
imagination, pure.
  Hence, it is important when doing deity yoga to put great effort into:
    * working at realizing emptiness as much as you can,
    * then imagining that the wisdom realizing emptiness appears itself
      as a compassionately directed divine body with a face, arms, and
      so forth,
    * and then taking this divine figure as the substratum and
      continuously meditating on its emptiness.

...when you explain or hear the teachings, if your mind and the teachings
remain separate, then whatever is explained will be inconsequential.  Hence,
listen in such a way that you determine how these teachings apply to your
mind.  For example, when you want to find out whether or not there is some
smudge, dirt, or whatever, on your face, you look in a mirror and then remove
whatever is there.  Similarly, when you listen to the teachings, your faults
such as misconduct and attachment appear in the mirror of the teachings.  At
that time, you regret that your mind has become like this, and you then work
to clear away those faults and establish good qualities.  Hence, you must
train in the teachings.

    if god exists, then god doesn't need me to believe in god.  it will not
harm god if i do not believe, because god's existence is not dependent on
my belief.  god could contact me directly if god existed and actually cared
what i believed, thus i see no reason to believe in god until then.  since
i don't need to believe in god, this frees me from wasting any mental
effort *believing* when that belief will not create god if god doesn't
exist, and when my disbelief will not destroy god if god does exist.
i can't change the state of god's existence one way or the other--i have
realized this limitation in my capabilities.
    instead, god needs to believe in me.  it's my existence that presumably
requires god's participation in some way, if god does exist.  but regardless
of any effort to placate a deity, i feel that i need to be the kind of person
who is worth believing in, by god or by anyone else.  my seeking perfection
should not come from fear of an ignored and needy deity.  i must build the
best moral and ethical system that i can come up with for myself in this life.
it is my own self-control and my behavior towards others that is the final
word on whether i am worth believing in.

Benefiting living beings is my main practice, and I would like to give a brief
introduction to the three qualities that are its basis: pure love, compassion,
and bodhichitta, the awakened mind.  Pure love is the desire that all living
beings have happiness and its causes.  Compassion is the desire that living
beings be free of suffering and its causes, such as unwholesome actions.
Bodhichitta is the desire that all living beings be free of suffering and that
we will be able to place them on the unsurpassed level of awakening, or
buddhahood.

How can we eliminate the deepest source of all unsatisfactory experience?
Only by cultivating certain qualities within our mindstream.  Unless we
possess high spiritual qualifications, there is no doubt that the events life
throws upon us will give rise to frustration, emotional turmoil, and other
distorted states of consciousness.  These imperfect states of mind in turn
give rise to imperfect activities, and the seeds of suffering are ever planted
in a steady flow.  On the other hand, when the mind can dwell in the wisdom
that knows the ultimate mode of being, one is able to destroy the deepest root
of distortion, negative karma and sorrow.

It is important to realize that there is nobody else who can wake us up and
save us from samsara.  There is no such thing in Buddhism.  That may be
Buddhism's biggest drawback, and at the same time its greatest advantage.
This view shows us that there is nobody else in control of our lives, our
experiences, our freedom or our bondage.  Who is responsible?  Who is in
control?  It is us.  We are in control.  We can bind ourselves further in
samsara or we can free ourselves from it right now.  It is all up to us.  We
are the ones who have to keep looking at our thoughts, looking for the nature
of our mind.  There is no guru, deity, buddha or bodhisattva out there to look
for it for us.  Although they would happily do this, it would not help us; it
would only help them.  We have to do it for ourselves.  That is the key point.
  -- Dzogchen Ponlop, "Mind Beyond Death", published by Snow Lion Publications

...mistakenly apprehending inherent existence in all phenomena
serves as the root of all other delusions...

    The opponent force powerful enough to eliminate the delusions should be a
wisdom which combines calm abiding and special insight.  In order to cultivate
an advanced meditative stabilization that is free of both subtle mental
sinking and mental excitement, first of all there should be a basis: the
practice of morality, an abstaining from negative actions.  Therefore, the
path leading to liberation is comprised of the three higher trainings: the
training of morality as the foundation, the training of meditative
stabilization as the complementing factor, and the actual path which is the
training of wisdom.  By enhancing the practice of wisdom and by developing it
to its fullest extent, you will be able to eliminate totally the delusions,
particularly ignorance which misapprehends the mode of being of phenomena.

    There is considerable ongoing debate regarding the traditional view of the
guru-disciple relationship, which asserts that seeing the guru as Buddha,
impeccable and without failings, is vital to ripen the disciple's potential to
attain the fruits of the path.  This is reinforced by the admonition that to
see faults in one's own guru will result in karmic downfalls and future
suffering for the disciple.  Any faults in the teacher should be seen as the
disciple's aberrations projected outside.  The tantric teachings insist this
pure view should be held at all times to protect the disciple from accruing
negative karma.
    However, underlying this is also the need to preserve the integrity,
authority, and status of the teacher.  This leads to a great deal of confusion
when students begin to see evident flaws in teachers, and it would be folly to
explain them away as the students' impure perception.  Consequently it has
become necessary to cultivate a less dogmatic, more pragmatic view.  A teacher
may not be a perfect carrier of the projection, but this does not contradict
the tantric view that essentially the guru, an inner phenomenon projected
outside, is Buddha.
    If we literalize this principle of the teacher as the embodiment of
perfection, we are in danger of blinding ourselves to the reality that most
teachers are human, and therefore not perfect.  An individual can have deep
insights into the nature of reality and still have human failings, a shadow
that has not been fully eradicated.  According to the teachings on the Ten
Grounds or Stages of the Bodhisattva, until the final ground is reached, there
are still subtle obscurations to full enlightenment that can manifest in
flawed behavior.  Believing without question that the outer guru is Buddha
also traps the teacher in an unrealistic, unconscious position.  The Dalai
Lama has commented that too much deference harms the teacher, because we never
challenge him or her.
    When disciples become devoted to teachers, considerable power and
authority is entrusted to them.  While a teacher's role is to support and
empower disciples to discover their own potential, sometimes this does not
happen.  Some teachers become caught in the powerful position they have been
endowed with and are unaware of their own desire for power and authority.
They may begin to enjoy their power too much and take advantage of it for
their own needs.  This keeps their disciples disempowered, and ultimately does
not allow growth and individual responsibility to emerge.  Teachers may be
unconsciously afraid to empower their disciples and allow them to gain a sense
of their own authority and autonomy.  They may try to hold on to their
disciples, when to genuinely empower them could lead to their leaving to
engage in their own journey.

    Batchelor, published by Snow Lion Publications

    Attachment increases desire, without producing any satisfaction.  There
are two types of desire, unreasonable and reasonable.  The first is an
affliction founded on ignorance, but the second is not.  To live, you need
resources; therefore, desire for sufficient material things is appropriate.
Such feelings as, "This is good; I want this.  This is useful," are not
afflictions.  It is also desirable to achieve altruism, wisdom, and
liberation.  This kind of desire is suitable; indeed, all human development
comes out of desire, and these aspirations do not have to be an affliction.
    ...when you have attachment to material things, it is best to desist from
those very activities that promote more attachment.  Satisfaction is helpful
when it comes to material things, but not with respect to spiritual practice.
Objects to which we become attached are something to be discarded, whereas
spiritual progress is something to be adopted--it can be developed
limitlessly, even in old age.

    Some people find it helpful to set a determination of a reasonable period
of time during which they will sit in meditation without moving.  If you do
this, do not make it into a contest in which you grit your teeth in pain just
to say that you sat without moving for a certain length of time.  That isn't
conducive for focusing with wisdom on the object of meditation.  On the other
hand, avoid moving whenever you feel the slightest bit of restlessness or
discomfort.  Doing that isn't conducive for developing concentration either.
Rather, note when there is the urge to move but don't move.  Observe the
sensation: Is it really pain or is it simply restless energy in the body?
Learn to differentiate between these two.  Learn, also, to differentiate
between pain and discomfort.  Watch and study both of those when they arise in
your field of experience.
    In general, when attachment, anger, jealousy, or other distracting
emotions arise, observe them without getting involved in their stories.
Experience the feeling, rather than repeat the story to yourself again and
again.  Be aware of what it feels like in your body when you are angry,
jealous, arrogant, or clingy.  Be aware of the feeling tone in your mind when
one of these emotions is present.  Observe how the feeling changes, never
remaining the same.
    ...It is important to avoid criticizing yourself when your mind is
distracted or dull.  Do not fall into discouraging thoughts or self-hatred
because these are unproductive and are to be abandoned on the path.  Remember
that internal transformation takes time and rejoice in your opportunity to
learn and practice the Dharma.  "Slowly, slowly," as Lama Thubten Yeshe used
to say.  Learn to be satisfied with what you are able to do now while you
aspire to improve in the future.

Buddhists take a vow of morality in the context of first taking refuge--in
Buddha, in the states of realization, and in the spiritual community.  Refuge
is the foundation for the practice of morality.  Buddha teaches us how to find
refuge from suffering and limitation, but the chief refuge, or source of
protection, is found in the states of realization achieved through practicing
morality, concentrated meditation, and wisdom.  ...A lama from the Drukpa
Kagyu tradition and I were very close.  We met frequently and always used to
joke, teasing each other back and forth.  On one occasion I asked him about
his spiritual experience.  He told me that when he was young, he was staying
with his lama who had him perform the preliminary practice of making a hundred
thousand prostrations to the Buddha, the doctrine, and the spiritual
community.  Early in the morning and late in the evening he had to make
prostrations on a low platform the length of his body.  His lama was
meditating in the dark in the next room; so to trick him into thinking he was
making prostrations he would tap with his knuckles on the prostration
platform.  Years later, after his lama passed away, he was taking a meditation
retreat in a cave, during which he recalled his lama's great kindness over
years of training him, and he wept and wept.  He almost fainted, but then
experienced the clear light, which he continuously practiced.  Subsequently,
after successful meditations he occasionally would remember past lives in
vivid reflections before him.

    A practitioner needs faith, or trust....  Guru Rinpoche said that we
should meditate in the same way that a sparrow enters a nest.  A sparrow
spends some time investigating whether or not it is safe to enter.  Once his
examination is over, he then enters unhesitatingly.  That's a wonderful
metaphor for practice.  First clear up all your doubts about your technique,
then throw yourself into the technique with no separation or self-
consciousness.  Of course, it's easy to say, but that is the direction toward
which we should be moving.
    Another necessary quality is determination.  It's easy to gear oneself up
for counting mantras or prostrations.  For some, physical discipline is also
easy.  But the determination of the meditator is different.  We must be
determined to strive to purify our obscurations until they're completely
gone--in other words, until our buddha-nature unobstructedly shines through.
When we sit, we decide to do our best not to be swayed by our negativity.  We
should cultivate this attitude at the beginning of our session.  Otherwise, no
matter how much we practice, we will daydream a lot and our meditation will
always be wishy-washy.  I know this from experience--I may do my session of
meditation, but it is tepid.  Why?  I don't have that inner strength to remain
unmoved by the arising of the various mental contents.

    The five subtler aggregates* will eventually be transformed into the
Buddhas of the five lineages.  They are now as if accompanied by mental
defilements.  When the defilements are removed, these factors do not become
any coarser or subtler; their nature remains, but [when they] become separated
from the faults of mental pollution, they become the Buddhas of the five
lineages.  So if you ask whether the Buddhas of the five lineages are present
now in our continuums, these factors are currently bound by faults, and since
there cannot be a Buddha who has a fault, they are not Buddhas.  One is not
yet fully enlightened, but that which is going to become a Buddha is present;
therefore, these factors presently existent in our continuums are Buddha seeds
and are called the Buddha nature, or the essence of the One Gone Thus
(Tathagatagarbha).
  * The five consituents that are included within a person's continuum--earth,
    water, fire, wind, and space--that will be purified into the five Buddha
    lineages [the exalted manifestations of these constituents].

    ...an inherently existent "I" appears to us, but instead of assenting to
that appearance and holding it to be true, we analyze how the "I" actually
exists.
    At those times in our life when there's a very solid feeling of "I," it's
helpful to examine how that "I" appears.  I remember the first time I stayed
out all night in college and my mother didn't know.  I came home the next day
with this feeling that "I" really existed: "I did this and my mother doesn't
know!"  The feeling of "I" was just enormous, incredibly solid, because I did
something I wasn't supposed to do.
    Examine how that "I" appears, that big "I," especially when you have a
strong emotion.  Get familiar with that sense of "I."  When somebody criticizes
us or accuses us of doing something that we didn't do, this feeling comes up
very quickly.  Usually, we're focused not on the feeling of "I," but on
attacking the other person or escaping from him.  But if we can step back,
it's an incredible opportunity to study the feeling of "I."  The person who
irritates us the most can be our best Dharma asset, because he gives us an
opportunity to look at this sense of "I."

One time when I was giving an exposition on Nagarjuna's "Fundamentals of the
Middle Way," which deals explicitly with the topic of emptiness, one student
who did not have a prior background of learning in great treatises made a
comment to another colleague.  He said: 'Today's teaching was a little
strange.  His Holiness began with the presentation of the Buddha's path and
built up the edifice one layer at a time.  Then, all of a sudden, he started
talking about emptiness and the absence of inherent existence, so that this
whole edifice he had spent much time building was completely dismantled.'
He couldn't really see the point.  There is that danger.  However, if we
understand the importance of the need to generate wisdom into emptiness as a
means of bringing about the cessation of the afflictions, particularly
fundamental ignorance, then we recognise the value of deepening our
realisation of emptiness.  Also, as Dharmakirti points out, emotions such as
loving kindness and compassion cannot directly challenge fundamental
ignorance.  It is only by cultivating insight into no-self that we can
directly overcome our fundamental ignorance.

Having committed yourself to certain practices, be steadfast and never
transgress the promises you have made.  Let go of everything that could tempt
you to do so and devote yourself entirely and single-mindedly to the
accomplishment of your aims.  For six years the Buddha did not waver from his
practice of the meditative stabilization known as "Pervading Space."  This
meditation focuses on the fundamental nature of phenomena, which is present
wherever there is space.  Everywhere throughout space there are suffering
living beings on whom this meditation also focuses with the compassionate wish
to relieve their suffering and the loving wish to give them happiness.  Thus
it combines essential wisdom and skillful means.

Suppose some mathematical creature from the moon were to reckon up the human

left.  Having noted that there was an arm on the right and one on the left, a
leg on the right and one on the left, he might go further and still find on
each side the same number of fingers, the same number of toes, twin eyes, twin
ears, twin nostrils, and even twin lobes of the brain.  At last he would take
it as a law; and then, where he found a heart on one side, would deduce that
there was another heart on the other.  And just then, where he most felt he
was right, he would be wrong.

Question: How can one work with deep fears most effectively?

DL: There are quite a number of methods.  The first is to think about actions
and their effects.  Usually when something bad happens, we say, "Oh, very
unlucky," and when something good happens, we say, "Oh, very lucky."  Actually,
these two words, lucky and unlucky, are insufficient.  There must be some
reason.  Because of a reason, a certain time became lucky or unlucky, but
usually we do not go beyond lucky or unlucky.  The reason, according to the
Buddhist explanation, is our past karma, our actions.

One way to work with deep fears is to think that the fear comes as a result of
your own actions in the past.  Further, if you have fear of some pain or
suffering, you should examine whether there is anything you can do about it.
If you can, there is no need to worry about it; if you cannot do anything,
then there is also no need to worry.

Another technique is to investigate who is becoming afraid.  Examine the
nature of your self.  Where is this I?  Who is I?  What is the nature of I?
Is there an I besides my physical body and my consciousness?  This may help.

Also, someone who is engaging in the Bodhisattva practices seeks to take
others' suffering onto himself or herself.  When you have fear, you can think,
"Others have fear similar to this; may I take to myself all of their fears."
Even though you are opening yourself to greater suffering, taking greater
suffering to yourself, your fear lessens.

Object of Negation

    When a subject is analyzed, the object to be negated is determined to be
either an appearance or something imagined.  It is not logical, [however,] to
negate momentary appearances, because reasonings cannot negate them.  To take
an example: for people with eye diseases, the appearances of floaters [bits of
optical debris], double moons, and the like do not stop as long as their
eyesight is impaired.  Similarly, as long as beings are not free from
unafflicted ignorance, illusionlike appearances [manifesting] to the six modes
of consciousness do not stop.
    It is not necessary to negate [appearances], because our mistakes do not
come from appearances: they arise from fixating on those [appearances].  This
is the case because if we do not fixate on appearances, we are not bound--we
are like a magician who, having conjured up a young woman, has no attachment
towards her.  [On the other hand, if,] like naive beings attached to an
illusory young woman, we fixate intensely [on appearances], our karma and
mental afflictions will increase.
    To intentionally negate appearances would be wrong because, if they were
negated, emptiness would come to mean the [absolute] nonexistence of things.
Another reason this would be a mistake is that yogins and yoginis meditating
on emptiness would fall into the extreme of nihilism since they would be
applying their minds to a negation that [equals] the [absolute] nonexistence
of everything.
    Thus, [Madhyamikas] set out to negate only what is imagined, because that
is what can be negated.  Like a rope mistaken for a snake, what is imagined
does not conform to facts: it is simply the mind's fixations.

    When your mind is trained in self-discipline, even if you are surrounded
by hostile forces, your peace of mind will hardly be disturbed.  On the other
hand, if your mind is undisciplined, your mental peace and calm can easily be
disrupted by your own negative thoughts and emotions.  The real enemy is
within, not outside.  Usually we define our enemy as a person, an external
agent, whom we believe is causing harm to us or to someone we hold dear.  But
such an enemy is dependent on many conditions and is impermanent.  One moment,
the person may act as an enemy; at yet another moment, he or she may become
your best friend.  This is a truth that we often experience in our own lives.
But negative thoughts and emotions, the inner enemy, will always remain the
enemy.  They are your enemy today, they have been your enemy in the past, and
they will remain your enemy in the future as long as they reside within your
mind.
    This inner enemy is extremely dangerous.  The destructive potential of an
external enemy is limited when compared to that of its inner counterpart....
In a time when every country is a potential target for the nuclear weapons of
others, human beings still continue to develop defense systems of greater and
greater sophistication.  I do not know if it will ever be possible to create a
defense system capable of guaranteeing worldwide protection against all
external forces of destruction.  However, one thing is certain: as long as
those destructive internal enemies of anger and hatred are left to themselves
unchallenged, the threat of physical annihilation will always loom over us.
In fact, the destructive power of an external enemy ultimately derives from
the power of these internal forces.  The inner enemy is the trigger that
unleashes the destructive power of the external enemy.
    Shantideva tells us that as long as these inner enemies remain secure
within, there is great danger.  Shantideva goes on to say that even if
everyone in the world were to stand up against you as your enemies and harm
you, as long as your own mind was disciplined and calm, they would not be able
to disturb your peace.  Yet a single instance of delusion arising in your mind
has the power to disturb that peace and inner stability.

(Each day before breakfast the founder and abbess of Sravasti Abbey, Thubten
Chodron, gives a morning motivation for residents and guests.  We were moved
by these inspiring words, and hope you will be, too.)

Morning Motivation

    Let's recall our motivation in the morning and think that today, the most
important thing I have to do is to guard my body, speech and mind so that I
don't harm anybody through what I do with my body, through what I say, or even
through what I think.  That's the most important thing, more important than
anything else today.
    The second most important thing is, as much as possible, to be of benefit
to others.  Thoroughly cultivate that as your motivation simply for being
alive today.  Our purpose for being alive isn't just to keep this body alive,
to eat and sleep, and have pleasure.  We have a higher purpose, a higher
meaning: to really work for the benefit of living beings.  If the purpose of
our life is simply to keep the body alive and have pleasure, then at the end
of life, we have nothing to show for it.  The body dies and all the pleasures,
like last night's dream, have gone.  But if we work for a higher motivation, a
higher purpose, to really do what's beneficial for all living beings, then
there's happiness and benefit now.
    At the end of the life, the benefit that we've given to others continues,
as do all the imprints of the attitude of kindness, the attitude of care
towards others.  All the imprints of having generated that positive mind go on
with us into the next life.  So even at the time of death, that kind heart
brings incredible benefit and carries through into the next life.
    And then let's also generate a third motivation--a really long-term
motivation--to become fully enlightened.  In other words, to have the wisdom,
compassion, and skill so that in the long term, we'll be able to be of the
greatest benefit to all living beings, even being able to lead them on the
path to enlightenment.  That's our really long-term purpose.
    As we change and develop a kind heart, that influences every single living
being we encounter in a positive way.  Then, through the influence on them, it
spreads out to all the people they know.  So, just spending one day with a
positive, long-term motivation may seem like a small thing, but when we think
of the ripple effect it has now, and the benefit it has in future lives and
for progressing along the path to liberation and enlightenment, we see that
even one day spent with this motivation of kindness, directly and indirectly
benefiting sentient beings, has tremendous outcomes--many, many good results.

     work, "Guided Meditations on the Stages of the Path", published by

    ...We can't blame one individual for what happens in our world.  I think
we should blame our entire society.  Society produces our leaders and
politicians, and if we try to develop a more compassionate and affectionate
society, we will have human beings with a more peaceful nature.  Leaders,
politicians, and businesspeople coming from such a society would offer hope
for a better world.  Our long-term responsibility--everyone's responsibility,
whether they are believers or nonbelievers--is to find ways to promote a
peaceful and compassionate society.
    I think one way is quite simple.  Each individual must try to ensure peace
and compassion in his [or her] family.  Put together ten peaceful,
compassionate homes, or one hundred, and that's a community.  The children in
such a society would receive affection in their family and in their schools
from the educators concerned.  We might have one or two setbacks, but
generally I think we could develop a sensible society.  Sensible here means a
sense of community, a sense of responsibility, and a sense of commitment.

     and Advice on Right Living", edited by Renuka Singh, published by

    We can see that there are many ways in which we actively contribute to our
own experience of mental unrest and suffering.  Although, in general, mental
and emotional afflictions themselves can come naturally, often it is our own
reinforcement of those negative emotions that makes them so much worse.  For
instance when we have anger or hatred towards a person, there is less
likelihood of its developing to a very intense degree if we leave it
unattended.  However, if we think about the projected injustices done to us,
the ways in which we have been unfairly treated, and we keep on thinking about
them over and over, then that feeds the hatred.  It makes the hatred very
powerful and intense.  Of course, the same can apply to when we have an
attachment towards a particular person; we can feed that by thinking about how
beautiful he or she is, and as we keep thinking about the projected qualities
that we see in the person, the attachment becomes more and more intense.  But
this shows how through constant familiarity and thinking, we ourselves can
make our emotions more intense and powerful.
    We also often add to our pain and suffering by being overly sensitive,
overreacting to minor things, and sometimes taking things too personally.  We
tend to take small things too seriously and blow them up out of proportion,
while at the same time we often remain indifferent to the really important
things, those things which have profound effects on our lives and long-term
consequences and implications.
    So I think that to a large extent, whether you suffer depends on how you
respond to a given situation.

     Happiness: A Handbook for Living"

    Realizations come only if we practice joyfully, with confidence and
courage.  Realization doesn't grow within a timid or weak state of mind--it
blossoms in the mind free of doubt and hesitation.  Realization is fearless.
When we see the true nature of reality, there's nothing hidden, nothing left
to fear.  At last we're seeing reality as it is, full of joy and peace.
    Our habitual patterns can only be removed by understanding the great
emptiness aspect of true nature, that which is named the Mother of all the
buddhas.  Emptiness is freedom; emptiness is great opportunity.  It is
pervasive and all phenomena arise from it.  As the great master Jigme Lingpa
said, "The entire universe is the mandala of the dakini." The Mother's mandala
is all phenomena, the display of the wisdom dakini.
    Without this ultimate great emptiness, the Mother of the buddhas, the
universe would be without movement, development, or change.  Because of this
great emptiness state of the Mother, we see phenomena continually arising.
Each display arises, transforms, and radiates, fulfilling its purpose and then
dissolving back into its original state.  This dramatic dance of energy is the
activity, ability, or mandala of the wisdom dakini.  Thus, the combination of
the great emptiness or openness state, together with the activities of love
and compassion, is both the ultimate Mother and the ultimate wisdom dakini.

Just as your innermost wish is to be free from suffering and to abide in
happiness, so too is it the aspiration of all other beings.  But, they, like
you, encounter sufferings and problems in their lives, and often their
difficulties are much worse than your own.  Examine your capacity to help
them.  At this time your ability to help them is quite limited, but if you
reduce your own ignorance, anger, attachment, and other faults, and increase
your good qualities such as generosity, patience, loving-kindness, compassion,
and wisdom, you will be of greater benefit.  If you become fully enlightened,
you will be of the greatest possible benefit to all beings.  Thus generate the
altruistic intention to become a Buddha in order to benefit all sentient
beings most effectively.

    In the first period, at Varanasi, Buddha turned the wheel of doctrine that
is based on the four noble truths; he did this mainly in consideration of
those having the lineage of Hearers (Sravaka).  In the middle period, at
Grdhrakuta, he set forth the middle wheel of doctrine, which is based on the
mode of non-inherent existence of all phenomena; he did this mainly in
consideration of trainees of sharp faculties who bear the Mahayana lineage.
In the final period, at Vaisali, he set forth the final wheel [which is based
on discriminating between those phenomena that do and those that do not truly
exist]; he did this mainly in consideration of trainees of middling and lower
faculties who bear the Mahayana lineage.  The teacher Buddha also appeared in
the body of Vajradhara, setting forth tantric doctrines.

clarity and change in our perceptions that we experience when we hear about
the qualities of the Three Jewels and the lives of the Buddha and the great
teachers.  Longing faith is experienced when we think about the latter and are
filled with a great desire to know more about their qualities and to acquire
these ourselves.  Confident faith comes through practicing the Dharma, when we
acquire complete confidence in the truth of the teachings and the
enlightenment of the Buddha.  Finally, when faith has become so much a part of
ourselves that even if our lives were at risk we could never give it up, it
has become irreversible faith.

    ...when seeking work, or if you already have a job, it is important to
keep in mind that a human being isn't meant to be some kind of machine
designed only for production.  No.  Human life isn't just for work, like [a
socialistic] vision where everyone's purpose is just to work for the state,
and there is no individual freedom, where the state even arranges the person's
vacations and everything is planned out for the individual.  That is not a
full human life.  Individuality is very important for a full human life, and
then accordingly some leisure time, a bit of holiday, and time spent with
family or friends.  That is the means to a complete form of life....  If your
life becomes only a medium of production, then many of the good human values
and characteristics will be lost--then you will not, you cannot, become a
complete person.
    So if you're looking for work and have a choice of a job, choose a job
that allows the opportunity for some creativity, and for spending time with
your family.  Even if it means less pay, personally I think it is better to
choose work that is less demanding, that gives you greater freedom, more time
to be with your family, or to do other activities, read, engage in cultural
activities, or just play.  I think that's best.

    Our painful experiences have brought the five poisons* right into our
world.  Our heavy sense of being a separate person has led to an anxiety about
our safety in the world.  This leads us to aversion and attachment, as we long
to predict and control our relation with the environment.  From this all the
other fixed and defensive positions arise.  And so the world that we encounter
is covered over and suffused with many subtle moods of hopes and fears,
doubts, jealousies, pride.  So even here on a dharma retreat, as we look
around the room, we have a complex sense of whose faces we can look at, and
who we might have to look away from.  This is not at all a neutral place.  The
force of projections, interpretations and impulsive reactions keeps us busy in
trying to stay ahead of the game....
    However in dzogchen we are trying to get to the essential point where
nirvana and samsara separate.  This is like a great weed killer: If you spray
it once all the weeds, all the confusion, all the pain and suffering will
vanish.  You don't need to pluck out each weed by itself.  Believing that you
are a bad person is very unhelpful for the practice of dzogchen.  Also
believing that you are a good person is not very helpful in the practice of
dzogchen.  You are not a person!  Resting in the unborn state we are a pure
awareness free of the least defilement.  When you give up your ego identity,
your samsara citizenship, you tear up your identity card and all the problems
and sins and police records linked to that identity vanish immediately.

    There is a Buddhist practice in which one imagines giving joy and the
source of all joy to other people, thereby removing all their suffering.
Though of course we cannot change their situation, I do feel that in some
cases, through a genuine sense of caring and compassion, through our sharing
in their plight, our attitude can help alleviate their suffering, if only
mentally.  However, the main point of this practice is to increase our inner
strength and courage.
    I have chosen a few lines that I feel would be acceptable to people of all
faiths, and even to those with no spiritual belief.  When reading these lines,
if you are a religious practitioner, you can reflect upon the divine form that
you worship.  Then, while reciting these verses, make the commitment to
enhance your spiritual values.  If you are not religious, you can reflect upon
the fact that, fundamentally, all beings are equal to you in their wish for
happiness and their desire to overcome suffering.  Recognizing this, you make
a pledge to develop a good heart.  It is most important that we have a warm
heart.  As long as we are part of human society, it is very important to be a
kind, warm-hearted person.
        May the poor find wealth,
        Those weak with sorrow find joy.
        May the forlorn find new hope,
        Constant happiness and prosperity.

        May the frightened cease to be afraid,
        And those bound be free.
        May the weak find power,
        And may their hearts join in friendship.

    Although there are as many categories of emptiness* as there are types of
phenomena, when you realize the emptiness of one specific phenomenon, you also
realize the emptiness of all phenomena.  The ultimate nature, or emptiness, of
all phenomena is of equal taste and of the same undifferentiable nature.  Even
though the nature of emptiness of all phenomena is the same, and all the
different aspects of phenomena, such as whether they are good or bad, or the
way they change, arise from the sphere of emptiness, you should understand
that emptiness cannot be found apart from the subject or the object.
    Emptiness refers to an object's being free of intrinsic existence.  Things
depend on causes and conditions.  This very dependence on causes and
conditions signifies that phenomena lack independent, or intrinsic, existence.
It also demonstrates how all the diverse aspects of things that we experience
arise because they are by nature empty.  When we talk about emptiness, we are
not dealing with those different aspects, we are dealing with phenomena's
ultimate reality.

The Treasure Discoverers
    Most of the influential terma [hidden treasures or teachings] were
purportedly secreted by Padmasambhava or his immediate disciples, and specific
instructions were also laid down for each terma at the time of its
concealment.  The theory behind this system is that certain teachings would be
especially effective at particular points in the future, and so they were
hidden in a "time release" system which assured that at the appropriate time a
terton would locate the teaching and disseminate it.  When Padmasambhava hid
these treasures, he prophesied the circumstances for the discovery of each
terma and the terton who would find it.  He predicted that there would be
three "grand" tertons, eight "great" ones, twenty-one "powerful" ones, one
hundred eight "intermediate," and one thousand "subsidiary" tertons.  Most of
these were to be recognized as emanations of Padmasambhava or his chief
disciples.
    ...Many hidden treasures still remain undiscovered, awaiting the proper
time for their dissemination.  They continue to reinvigorate the Nyingma
tradition, and a number have been incorporated into other lineages.  The
institution of terma serves as a link with the past of the tradition, a link
that periodically revitalizes the present and points the way to the future.
The system reflects the Mahayana ideal of skill in means, the ability to adapt
teachings to changing circumstances.

    Practicing compassion will bring about the recognition of emptiness* as
the true nature of the mind.  When you practice virtuous actions of love and
compassion on the relative level, you spontaneously realize the profound
nature of emptiness, which is the absolute level.  In turn, if you focus your
meditation practice on emptiness, then your loving-kindness and compassion
will spontaneously grow.
    These two natures, the absolute and the relative, are not opposites; they
always arise together.  They have the same nature; they are inseparable like a
fire and its heat or the sun and its light.  Compassion and emptiness are not
like two sides of a coin.  Emptiness and compassion are not two separate
elements joined together; they are always coexistent.
    In Buddhism, emptiness does not mean the absence of apparent existence.
Emptiness is not like a black hole or darkness, or like an empty house or an
empty bottle.  Emptiness is fullness and openness and flexibility.  Because of
emptiness it is possible for phenomena to function, for beings to see and
hear, and for things to move and change.  It is called emptiness because when
we examine things we cannot find anything that substantially and solidly
exists.  There is nothing that has a truly existent nature.  Everything we
perceive appears through ever-changing causes and conditions, without an
independent, solid basis.  Although from a relative perspective things appear,
they arise from emptiness and they dissolve into emptiness.  All appearances
are like water bubbles or the reflection of the moon in water.

[Preceding story: Before reaching enlightenment, the Buddha was born as Prince
Visvantara, who, despite facing many challenges and adversity, brought all of
his heart and courage to bear against a single enemy--human suffering.]

In giving we not only find wealth while in cyclic existence but we achieve the
zenith of prosperity in supreme enlightenment.  Therefore we all have to
practice giving.  A Bodhisattva's giving is not just overcoming miserliness
and being generous to others; a pure wish to give is cultivated, and through
developing more and more intimacy with it, such giving is enhanced infinitely.
Therefore it is essential to have the firm mind of enlightenment rooted in
great love and compassion and, from the depths of one's heart, to either give
one's body, wealth and virtues literally to sentient beings as infinite as
space, or to dedicate one's body, wealth and virtues for them while striving
in all possible ways to enhance the wish to give infinitely.  As mentioned in
Engaging in Bodhisattva Activities and in The Precious Garland, we should
literally give material help to the poor and needy, give teaching to others,
and give protection to them, even the small insects, as much as we can.  In
the case of things which we are not able to part with, we should cultivate the
wish to give them away and develop more and more intimacy with that wish.

    Mad yogins are known in virtually every tradition in Tibet, but most often
in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, and also in the Shije (Pacification) and
Chod traditions.  The Nyingma, Kagyu, and Chod traditions are the three with
which Tangtong Gyalpo had the closest ties.  One of the texts in Tangtong's
Oral Transmission, a collection of teachings originally passed down from
Tangtong, quotes the great yogini Machik Labdron's statement concerning proper
yogic conduct following realization.  In response to a question by one of her
sons, Machik recommended that a practitioner act like a child with unfeigned
spontaneity, like a lunatic with no regard for what is conventionally
acceptable, like a leper with no attachment to his or her own physical health,
and like a wild animal wandering in isolated and rough terrain.
    ...Guru Padmasambhava himself prophesied that Tangtong Gyalpo would care
for living beings by means of unpredictable actions.  Tangtong's unusual
conduct began to manifest at an early age, and resembled traits noted in the
lives of other mad yogins.  He was first called insane by his father and the
members of his village when, as a child, he subdued a malicious spirit
responsible for an epidemic.  Several other early incidents are mentioned in
the biographies.  When he went to take scholastic examinations at the renowned
monastery of Sakya he earned the nickname Tsondru Nyonpa (Crazy Tsondru)
because of his disinterest in explaining the scriptural definitions of the
highest states of realization.  He preferred to spend his time absorbed in
actually experiencing these states.  When he was later practicing deliberate
behavior secretly in a vast and empty wasteland, the dakinis gave him five
names indicating his high realization, one of which was Lungtong Nyonpa
(Madman of the Empty Valley).

    ...In the Buddhist teachings, when we search for the causes of suffering,
we find what is called 'the truth of the origin of suffering', namely that
negative actions--karma--and the negative emotions that induce such actions
are the causes of suffering.
    Talking about causes, if we take a step further and investigate more
deeply, we find that the cause alone is not sufficient for bringing about the
results.  Causes themselves have to come in contact with co-operative
circumstances or conditions.  For instance, say we search for a material or
substantial cause for this plant, we will find that it has a continuity
stretching back into beginningless time.
    There are certain Buddhist texts that speak of space particles, existing
before the evolution of this present universe.  According to these texts, the
space particles serve as the material and substantial cause for matter, such
as this plant.  Now if the essential and substantial cause for matter is
traced to these space particles, which are all the same, how do we account for
the diversity that we see in the material world?  It is here that the question
of conditions and circumstances comes into play.  When these substantial
causes come in contact with different circumstances and conditions, they give
rise to different effects, that is, different kinds of matter.  So we find
that the cause alone is not sufficient for bringing about a result.  What is
required is an aggregation of many different conditions and circumstances.
    Although you can find certain differences among the Buddhist philosophical
schools about how the universe came into being, the basic common question
addressed is how the two fundamental principles--external matter and internal
mind or consciousness--although distinct, affect one another.  External causes
and conditions are responsible for certain of our experiences of happiness and
suffering.  Yet we find that it is principally our own feelings, our thoughts
and our emotions, that really determine whether we are going to suffer or be
happy.

    Right now many of us wish for liberation, yet sometimes we cannot keep
ourselves from creating the causes for cyclic existence.  When we understand
true suffering well, our wish for liberation will become firm.  At present our
resolve to reach liberation is not firm because we think of suffering, but not
deeply.  The deluded attitude believing that the unsatisfactoriness of change
is true happiness easily arises in us because we are not yet deeply convinced
that all happiness in cyclic existence is contaminated and is in fact only a
variety of suffering.  To remedy this, we should meditate on true suffering
more often and explore its meaning deeply.  Then our wish for liberation will
become firm.
    We consider many things--clothes, food, good health, nice possessions,
financial security, the higher rebirths--as true happiness.  As a result, we
are attached to them and create more causes for suffering in cyclic existence
in order to gain them.  Thinking that the human birth is something marvelous,
we work at creating the causes that propel us toward it.  In fact all we are
doing is creating the cause for yet another rebirth in cyclic existence,
together with all the problems that such a rebirth involves.
    If we understand that by its nature, cyclic existence is unsatisfactory,
we will have a deep aversion to it.  If we do not have a deep aversion to it,
we will not be determined to be free, and therefore will not be able to
destroy our self-grasping ignorance, which is the root of cyclic existence.
In that case, we will not be able to attain liberation.  However, when we
deeply feel the extent to which we suffer in cyclic existence, we will
automatically want to abandon the true origin of suffering, attain the true
cessation, and meditate on the true path.  Having realized true suffering, we
will easily realize the other three of the four noble truths.  Thus it is
said: suffering is to be known.  The origin is to be abandoned.  The cessation
is to be attained.  The path is to be practiced.  The determination to be free
is the wish for ourselves to be free of cyclic existence.  When we wish others
to be free, that is compassion.

    Mantras are invocations to buddhas... prayers, or a combination of these.
Tantric practitioners repeat them in order to forge karmic connections between
themselves and meditational deities and to effect cognitive restructuring
through internalizing the divine attributes that the mantra represents.  A
person who wishes to develop greater compassion, for instance, might recite
the mantra of Avalokitesvara, who embodies this quality: om mani padme hum...
[a] mantra [that] is well known to Tibetans.  It represents for them the
perfect compassion of Avalokitesvara, who they believe has taken a special
interest in the spiritual welfare of the Tibetan people.  He epitomizes
universal compassion that is unsullied by any trace of negative emotions or
mental afflictions.
    Among ordinary beings there are, of course, many acts of compassion, but
these are generally tinged by self-interest, pride, or desire for recognition.
Avalokitesvara's compassion, by contrast, is completely free from all
afflictions and is so vast that it encompasses all sentient beings without
exception and without distinction.  People who wish to develop such a
perspective recite Avalokitesvara's mantra over and over, meditating on its
significance, and in so doing they try to restructure their minds in
accordance with the cultivation of his exalted qualities.  According to the
Dalai Lama,
    'mani'...  symbolizes the factors of method--the altruistic intention to
become enlightened, compassion, and love.  Just as a jewel is capable of
removing poverty, so the altruistic mind of enlightenment is capable of
removing the poverty, or difficulties, of cyclic existence and of solitary
peace....  The two syllables, 'padme'... symbolize wisdom.  Just as a lotus
grows forth from mud but is not sullied by the faults of mud, so wisdom is
capable of putting you in a situation of non-contradiction whereas there would
be contradiction if you did not have wisdom....  Purity must be achieved by an
indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the final syllable
'hum', which indicates indivisibility....  Thus the six syllables, 'om mani
padme hum', mean that in dependence on a path which is an indivisible union of
method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into
the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha.

    "Now let's look at ultimate reality," the Dalai Lama said, pointing a
little finger to his mug.  "What exactly is it?  We're seeing color, shape.
But if we take away shape, color, material, what is mug?  Where is the mug?
This mug is a combination of particles: atoms, electrons, quarks.  But each
particle is not 'mug.'  The same can be said about the four elements, the
world, everything.  The Buddha.  We cannot find the Buddha.  So that's the
ultimate reality.  If we're not satisfied with conventional reality, if we go
deep down and try to find the real thing, we ultimately won't find it."
    Thus, the Dalai Lama was saying, the mug is empty.  The term "mug" is
merely a label, something we use to describe everyday reality.  But each mug
comes into existence because of a complex web of causes and conditions.  It
does not exist independently.  It cannot come into being by itself, of its own
volition.
    For example: suppose I decide to make a black mug.  To do this, I mix
black clay and water, shape it to my liking, and fire the resulting mixture in
an oven.  Clay plus water turns into a mug because of my actions.  But it
exists because of the myriad different ways that atoms and molecules interact.
And what about me, the creator of the black mug?  If my parents had never met,
the black mug might never have existed.
    Therefore the mug does not exist independently.  It comes into being only
through a complex web of relationships.  In the Dalai Lama's own words, and
this is the key concept in his worldview, the mug is "dependently originated."
It came to be a mug because of a host of different factors, not under its own
steam.  It is empty.  "Empty" is shorthand for "empty of intrinsic, inherent
existence." Or to put it another way, empty is another word for
interdependent.

    Buddha teaches that one should not practice extremes....  As Nagarjuna's
"Precious Garland of Advice" says,
        Practice is not done
        By mortifying the body,
        Since you have not forsaken injuring others
        And are not helping others.
    When you disregard the basic needs of the body, you harm the many sentient
organisms that live within the body.  You should also avoid the opposite
extreme of living in great luxury.  It is possible to make use of good food,
clothing, residence, and furnishings without producing afflictive emotions
such as attachment, pride, and arrogance.  The crucial point is the control of
internal factors such as lust and attachment; external factors are not in and
of themselves good or bad.  It is not suitable if attachment increases toward
even mediocre food, clothing, and so forth.
    Contentment is the key.  If you have contentment with material things, you
are truly rich.  Without it, even if you are a billionaire, you will not have
happiness.  You will always feel hungry and want more and more and more,
making you not rich but poor.  If you seek contentment externally, it will
never happen.  Your desire will never be fulfilled.  Our texts speak of a king
who gained control over the world, at which point he began thinking about
taking over the lands of the gods.  In the end his good qualities were
destroyed by pride.  Contentment is necessary for happiness, so try to be
satisfied with adequate food, clothing, and shelter.

     Relationships", translated and edited by Jeffrey Hopkins

There is another way of speaking about the two types of meditation.  In this
case, they are differentiated into 1) meditation that perceives the object and
2) meditation in which our mind is transformed into a specific affective
state.  An example of the former is meditating on impermanence and emptiness.
These are subtle objects that we must use analytical meditation to perceive.
An example of the latter is meditation on the four immeasurables
(brahmaviharas)--love, compassion, joy, and equanimity.  Here we are not
trying to perceive a subtle object, but are practicing to transform our minds
into those mental states.  For example, everyone admires the quality of love,
but we cannot just say, "I should love everyone," and expect our deepest
feelings to change.  First, we must free our minds from the gross obstacles of
attachment to friends, hostility to people who threaten or harm us, and apathy
towards strangers.  On this basis, we then train our mind to recognize the
kindness of others, which arouses in us a natural wish to reciprocate and
share our kindness with them.  After this we meditate on love and cultivate a
genuine wish for all sentient beings to have happiness and its causes.
Initially that feeling will arise in us but will not be stable.  Anger may
still flash into our mind making our good feelings towards others disappear.
We need to cultivate love continuously and do so with a focused mind.  The
greater our concentration, the more stable and penetrative the experience
will be.

    ...for the Christian practitioner, the Creator and the acceptance of the
Creator as almighty, is a very important factor within that tradition in order
to develop self-discipline, compassion, or forgiveness and to increase them in
one's intimate relationship with God.  That's something very essential.  In
addition, when God is seen as absolute and almighty, the concept that
everything is relative becomes a little bit difficult.  However, if one's
understanding of God is in terms of an ultimate nature of reality or ultimate
truth, then it is possible to have a kind of unified approach.
    ...As to one's personal religion, I think this must be based on one's own
mental disposition....  Generally speaking, I think it is better to practice
according to your own traditional background, and certainly you can use some
of the Buddhist techniques.  Without accepting rebirth theory or the
complicated philosophy, simply use certain techniques to increase your power
of patience and compassion, forgiveness, and things like that.

When we compare two ancient spiritual traditions like Buddhism and
Christianity, what we see is a striking similarity between the narratives of
the founding masters: in the case of Christianity, Jesus Christ, and in the
case of Buddhism, the Buddha.  I see a very important parallel: in the very
lives of the [founders] the essence of their teachings is demonstrated.  For
example...  the essence of the Buddha's teaching is embodied in the Four Noble
Truths: the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the
truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to this
cessation.  These Four Noble Truths are very explicitly and clearly
exemplified in the life of...  the Buddha himself.  I feel [it] is the same
with the life of Christ.  If you look at the life of Jesus, you will see all
the essential practices and teachings of Christianity exemplified.  And in the
lives of both Jesus Christ and the Buddha, it is only through hardship,
dedication and commitment, and by standing firm on one's principles that one
can grow spiritually and attain liberation.  That seems to be a central and
common message.

    With the achievement of quiescence, the attention is drawn inwards and is
maintained continuously, single-pointedly upon its object.  Tsongkhapa
emphasizes that genuine quiescence is necessarily preceded by an experience of
an extraordinary degree of mental and physical pliancy, which entails an
unprecedented sense of mental and physical fitness and buoyancy.
    In the state of meditative equipoise, only the aspects of awareness,
clarity, and joy of the mind appear, and all one's other sense faculties
remain dormant.  Thus, while one's consciousness seems as if it has become
indivisible with space, one lacks any sensation of having a body; and when
rising from that state, it seems as if one's body is suddenly coming into
being.  When genuine quiescence is achieved, one's attention can effortlessly
be maintained for hours, even days, on end, with no interference by either
laxity or excitation.

    In Mahayana Buddhism, when one takes the bodhisattva vow, one pledges to
work tirelessly in this life and all future lives to awaken oneself and purify
oneself in order to help all other beings attain freedom from suffering
through spiritual enlightenment.  One vows to help beings whenever possible,
and a profound way of doing this is to give a being the gift of life through
an act of kindness.  This can take the form of helping an animal in danger
cross the road to safety before being struck by a vehicle or freeing an animal
that is in captivity before it is killed by buying it from the captor and
letting it roam free.  If one is in a position to help save another's life--
whether a human or an animal--one must practice fearless kindness to help the
other being in danger.
    In Tibetan Buddhism, it is believed that due to the countless incarnations
all beings have undergone throughout time, at one point or another any given
living creature has been one's mother in a past life.  Therefore, it is viewed
as an obligation to repay the kindness of those who are referred to as "mother
sentient beings."  If your own mother in this life were in danger, you would
certainly do whatever you could to save her life.  Similarly, dedicated
holders of the bodhisattva vow feel this kind of urgency to save the lives of
all "mother sentient beings."

    In the frenzy of modern life we lose sight of the real value of humanity.
People become the sum total of what they produce.  Human beings act like
machines whose function is to make money.  This is absolutely wrong.  The
purpose of making money is the happiness of humankind, not the other way
around.  Humans are not for money, money is for humans.  We need enough to
live, so money is necessary, but we also need to realize that if there is too
much attachment to wealth, it does not help at all.  As the saints of India
and Tibet tell us, the wealthier one becomes, the more suffering one endures.
    ...Eating, working, and making money are meaningless in themselves.
However, even a small act of compassion grants meaning and purpose to our
lives.

Unlike the Lesser Vehicle tenet systems, which teach only a selflessness of
persons, the Great Vehicle tenet systems teach that the most profound reality,
the most subtle and important type of selflessness, is a selflessness, or
emptiness, that is a quality of all phenomena.  They hold that the bodhisattva
trains in altruistically motivated meditation on the emptiness of all
phenomena, thus preparing for the omniscience of buddhahood.  Some Great
Vehicle systems maintain that Lesser Vehicle practitioners do not realize the
profound emptiness of phenomena at all and are therefore unable to overcome
the obstructions to omniscience.  However, the highest system, the Middle Way
Consequence system, holds that persons on Lesser Vehicle paths do realize
emptiness, but are unable to achieve omniscience on their paths because their
wisdom is not empowered by association with altruism and altruistically
motivated actions of giving, ethics, patience, etc.

Selflessness in Context: Ultimate Bodhichitta
    Let us return for a moment to the beginning of [the Heart] Sutra where the
Buddha enters into the meditative absorption called "appearance of the
profound" and Avalokiteshvara beholds the practice of the profound perfection
of wisdom.  Generally speaking, the expression "appearance of the profound"
refers to the bodhisattva deeds, which are encompassed in the practice of the
six perfections.  Here, however, the expression refers particularly to the
perfection of wisdom, known in Sanskrit as prajnaparamita.  What the text
means by "perfection of wisdom" is a direct, unmediated realization of
emptiness that is also called "ultimate bodhichitta." This is not the direct
realization of emptiness alone; rather it is this direct realization in union
with bodhichitta--the aspiration to become a buddha in order to free all
beings.  This union of wisdom and method constitutes the first bhumi, or level
of bodhisattva attainment.
    The importance of this altruistic aspiration cannot be overstated.
Bodhichitta is not only important as a motivating factor at the beginning of
practice, it is also important as a complementary and a reinforcing factor
during every stage of the path.  The bodhichitta aspiration is twofold,
comprised both of the wish to help others and of the wish to become
enlightened so that one's assistance will be supremely effective.

From "The Prayer Requested by Namke Nyingbo" by Padmasambhava

All these things of the outer environment and the beings therein
That come into sight as the objects of your eyes like this,
They may appear, but leave them in the sphere free from clinging to a self.
Since they are pure of perceiver and perceived, they are the luminous-empty
    body of the deity.
I pray to the guru in whom attachment is self-liberated,
I pray to Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

All these sounds, taken as pleasant or unpleasant,
That resound as the objects of your ears like this,
Leave them in the sphere of inconceivable, empty resonance.
Empty resonance, unborn and unceasing, is the Victor's speech.
I pray to the words of the Victor that resound and yet are empty,
I pray to Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

However these thoughts of afflictions' five poisons,
Which stir as objects in your mind like this, may appear,
Do not mess around with them through a mind that rushes ahead into the future
    or lingers in the past.
Through leaving their movement in its own place, they uncoil as the
    dharmakaya.
I pray to the guru whose awareness is self-liberated,
I pray to Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

Grant your blessings that the mind stream of someone like me is liberated
    Through the compassion of the Tathagatas of the three times,
So that objects, appearing as if perceived outside, become pure,
That my very mind, perceiving as if inside, becomes liberated,
And that, in between, luminosity will recognize its own face.

    Some people feel that although it may be right to curb feelings of intense
hatred which can cause us to be violent and even to kill, we are in danger of
losing our independence when we restrain our emotions and discipline the mind.
Actually, the opposite is true.  Like their counterparts of love and
compassion, anger and the afflictive emotions can never be used up.  They
have, rather, a propensity to increase, like a river flooding in summer when
the snow melts, so that far from being free, our minds are enslaved and
rendered helpless by them.  When we indulge our negative thoughts and
feelings, inevitably we become accustomed to them.  As a result, gradually we
become more prone to them and more controlled by them.  And we become
habituated to exploding in the face of displeasing circumstances.
    Inner peace, which is the principal characteristic of happiness, and anger
cannot coexist without undermining one another.  Indeed, negative thoughts and
emotions undermine the very causes of peace and happiness.  In fact, when we
think properly, it is totally illogical to seek happiness if we do nothing to
restrain angry, spiteful, and malicious thoughts and emotions.  Consider that
when we become angry, we often use harsh words.  Harsh words can destroy
friendship.  Since happiness arises in the context of our relationships with
others, if we destroy friendships, we undermine one of the very conditions of
happiness itself.

Two Senses of Self

    Psychologists talk about people who are co-dependent because they don't
have a sense of self.  What psychologists mean when they say a person has no
sense of self is very different from what the Buddha meant by no-self or
selflessness.  People with psychological problems actually have a very strong
sense of self in the Buddhist sense, although they may not in the
psychological sense of the word.  Psychologically, they don't see themselves
as efficacious individuals in the world, but they still have a very strong
sense of "I": "I am worthless."  When somebody criticizes them, they don't
like it.  They get into co-dependent relationships to protect or to please
this "I."  When they fall into self-pity, their sense of an inherently
existent "I" is very strong.  Thus they still have self-grasping even though
they lack a psychologically healthy sense of self.
    Buddhism recognizes two kinds of sense of self.  There's one sense of self
that is healthy and necessary to be efficacious on the path.  The object of
this sense of self is the conventionally existent "I."  The other sense of
self grasps at an inherently existent self that never has and never will
exist.  Within Buddhism, when we talk about realizing emptiness, we're
negating the false self, this self that appears inherently existent to us.

     Chenrezig", foreword by H.H. the Dalai Lama, published by Snow Lion

    Question: If a person views the self and other phenomena as being empty of
any inherent existence, is it then, in that state, possible for them to take
any animate or inanimate phenomenon as their object, and through the power of
imputation or words, enable that object to actually take on a manifesting role
with the qualities which we view objects to have?

    His Holiness: This is an instance of not properly understanding the
meaning of "lack of inherent existence." If we think that "emptiness" means
things cannot function, then, with an improper understanding of the view of
emptiness, one will have fallen into nihilism.  So, because one has failed to
reconcile emptiness and the fact that things work, this view is incorrect.
That is why it is said that the meaning of emptiness is to be understood in
terms of dependent arising.
    Now, since the meaning of emptiness is to be explained in terms of
dependent arising, we can only explain something as arising dependently if
there is a basis, that is, some thing that is dependent.  Hence, such a basis
must exist.  We see then that when we speak of dependent arising, we are
indicating that things work.  Dependent arising proves that things have no
inherent existence, through the fact that things work in dependence on each
other.  The fact that things work and the fact that they do so in dependence,
one on the other, eliminates the possibility of their being independent.  This
in turn precludes the possibility of inherent existence, since, to inherently
exist means to be independent.  Hence, the understanding of emptiness, of the
the emptiness of a kind of inherent existence that is independent, boils down
to understanding dependent arising.

    In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the most profound and commonly
practiced teachings are those of the Vajrayana.  Within this powerful system
of skillful means, the supreme view and most potent methods are found in the
teachings and practices of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection.  These instructions
are regarded as the pinnacle of the teachings and as the most direct path to
realizing the nature of mind and the reality of the world.
    The instructions of the Dzogchen lineage are used to directly point out
the nature of mind and bring the experience of enlightenment into our ordinary
life.  These teachings are known as "pith instructions," the pure,
quintessential knowledge that cuts through all confusion and gets straight to
the point.  There is a saying, "Don't beat around the bush," meaning, "Get to
the point." That is Dzogchen.
    In many ways, these teachings go beyond scripture and the formality of
spiritual techniques.  These two do have their place, since it is important to
study scripture and meditate in a step-by-step manner.  Yet, at some point we
also must connect directly with the nature of mind.  We have to strike the
crucial point, the enlightened state, and leap directly into experiencing and
realizing the true nature of our mind.

    Dzogchen teaches that practice conducted with contriving, rough, fleeting
minds cannot bring enlightenment.  Only practice with the deep awareness of
non-contriving rigpa--pure awareness--can bring us to the state of a Buddha.
We can understand this in the same way as we do the statement that practice of
the yoga class of tantras and below cannot bring us enlightenment by itself.
The ultimate, deepest reason why it cannot is that the pathways of practice of
these levels of teaching cannot by themselves make manifest the deep awareness
of subtlest clear light mind.  Without the manifestation of the deep awareness
of clear light mind, we do not have the perpetrating causes for an
enlightening body and enlightening mind of a Buddha--causes that are in the
same uncommon category of phenomena as a Buddha's body and mind.  Therefore,
no matter how much we practice with pathway minds of yoga tantra and below, we
are never able to attain to enlightenment on their basis alone.
    ...when we make clear light mind of deep awareness prominent or enhanced
through techniques presented in the anuttarayoga tantra texts, and then
transform it into the nature of being a pathway mind, only then do we have
what can actualize an enlightening body and enlightening mind of a Buddha.

    Whenever you consider there is bliss, and the objective conditions for
bliss occur, if you fall under the control of that by becoming arrogant or
conceited, then that will fester as an obstruction to the spiritual path.
Rather than thinking about what has caused this happiness, which most probably
is the accumulation of merit or the removal of obscurations, as soon as the
bliss occurs, you think, "That's my nature."  Based on that, you become
arrogant or lazy, thinking, "Well, I've accomplished it."  This is the
greatest obstacle to the spiritual path.  This is what creates the realms
of deva-gods.  Oftentimes it is said that people can handle only a little bit
of felicity, but they can handle a lot of adversity.  This is because
happiness on the spiritual path is the most difficult thing to handle.  Once
it arises, that's where the path stops.
    This does not mean that it is necessary to give it all up.  Giving up
happiness is not the practice.  The main point is not to become mesmerized by
happiness as the end result.  You realize that, "Ah, now, the good quality of
this is that I am fortunate, and this is another result of the great fortune
of the path and the result of the accumulation of merit and wholesome deeds.
Even more than ever, I will carry on with the work at hand to achieve
liberation from cyclic existence."  So with more diligence and more courage,
you continue listening to teachings, contemplating, meditating, and
appreciating this precious human rebirth.

    As to what might be the mechanism through which karma plays a causal role
in the evolution of sentience, I find helpful some of the explanations given
in the Vajrayana traditions, often referred to by modern writers as esoteric
Buddhism.  According to the Guhyasamaja tantra, a principal tradition within
Vajrayana Buddhism, at the most fundamental level, no absolute division can be
made between mind and matter.  Matter in its subtlest form is prana, a vital
energy which is inseparable from consciousness.  These two are different
aspects of an indivisible reality.  Prana is the aspect of mobility, dynamism,
and cohesion, while consciousness is the aspect of cognition and the capacity
for reflective thinking.  So according to the Guhyasamaja tantra, when a world
system comes into being, we are witnessing the play of this energy and
consciousness reality.
    ...Despite the success of the Darwinian narrative, I do not believe that
all the elements of the story are in place.  To begin with, although Darwin's
theory gives a coherent account of the development of life on this planet and
the various principles underlying it, such as natural selection, I am not
persuaded that it answers the fundamental question of the origin of life.
Darwin himself, I gather, did not see this as an issue.  Furthermore, there
appears to be a certain circularity in the notion of "survival of the
fittest." The theory of natural selection maintains that, of the random
mutations that occur in the genes of a given species, those that promote the
greatest chance of survival are most likely to succeed.  However, the only
way this hypothesis can be verified is to observe the characteristics of
those mutations that have survived.  So in a sense, we are stating simply
this: "Because these genetic mutations have survived, they are the ones that
had the greatest chance of survival."
    From the Buddhist perspective, the idea of these mutations being purely
random events is deeply unsatisfying for a theory that purports to explain the
origin of life.  ...One empirical problem in Darwinism's focus on the
competitive survival of individuals, which is defined in terms of an
organism's struggle for individual reproductive success, has consistently been
how to explain altruism, whether in the sense of collaborative behavior, such
as food sharing or conflict resolution among animals like chimpanzees or acts
of self-sacrifice.  There are many examples, not only among human beings but
among other species as well, of individuals who put themselves in danger to
save others.
    ...From the scientific view, the theory of karma may be a metaphysical
assumption--but it is no more so than the assumption that all of life is
material and originated out of pure chance.

     Science and Spirituality"

    Praising others should be part of our daily life and a component of our
Dharma practice.  Imagine what our life would be like if we trained our minds
to dwell on others' talents and good attributes.  We would feel much happier
and so would they!  We would get along better with others, and our families,
work environments, and living situations would be much more harmonious.  We
plants the seeds from such positive actions on our mindstream, creating the
cause for harmonious relationships and success in our spiritual and temporal
aims.
    An interesting experiment is to try to say something nice to or about
someone every day for a month.  Try it.  It makes us much more aware of what
we say and why.  It encourages us to change our perspective so that we notice
others' good qualities.  Doing so also improves our relationships
tremendously.
    A few years ago, I gave this as a homework assignment at a Dharma class,
encouraging people to try to praise even someone they didn't like very much.
The next week I asked the students how they did.  One man said that the first
day he had to make something up in order to speak positively to a fellow
colleague.  But after that, the man was so much nicer to him that it was easy
to see his good qualities and speak about them!

    If, after having performed a virtuous action and accumulated its potency,
that potency remained without degenerating until its fruit issued forth in
either this or a future life, it would not be so fragile.  But that is not the
case.  Rather, the generation of a strong nonvirtuous state of mind, such as
anger, overpowers the capacity of a virtuously established potency so that it
cannot issue forth, much like scorching a seed.  Conversely, the generation of
a strong virtuous attitude overpowers potencies established by nonvirtues,
making them unable to issue their effects.  Thus it is necessary not only to
achieve many powerful constructive causes but also to avoid contrary forces
that would cause those beneficial causes to degenerate.
    The good actions required for accumulating these causes, or potencies,
arise from a tamed mind, whereas bad actions arise from an untamed mind.
Common beings like us have been accustomed to an untamed mind since
beginningless time.  Given this predisposition, we can conclude that actions
performed with an untamed mind are more powerful for us and actions performed
with a tamed mind are weaker.  It is important to appreciate that this
excellent life support of a human body that we now possess is a wholesome
result of many powerful good actions from a tamed mind in the past.  It was
very difficult to gain, and, since it is very rare, you must take care to use
it well, making sure that it is not wasted.
    ...If this human endowment, so difficult to attain, were stable and
permanent--not prone to deterioration--there would be time later to make use
of it.  However, this life-support system is fragile and easily disintegrates
from many external and internal causes.  Aryadeva's "Four Hundred Stanzas on
the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas" says that once the body depends on the four
elements of earth, water, fire, and wind, which themselves oppose each other,
physical happiness is just an occasional balance of these elements, not an
enduring harmony.
    ...So this human body is a precious endowment, potent and yet fragile.
Simply by virtue of being alive, you are at a very important juncture, and
carry a great responsibility.  Powerful good can be achieved for yourself and
others, so becoming distracted by the minor affairs of this lifetime would be
a tremendous waste.  You should make wishes to use this lifetime in this body
effectively and make petitions to your guru, the three refuges, and other
sources of help.  In doing so, urge yourself on from the inside and seek
assistance from the outside.....
    In sum, since this human body, which supports your life, is beneficial,
was difficult to gain, and easily disintegrates, you should use it for your
benefit and that of others.  Benefits come from a tamed mind: When your mind
is peaceful, relaxed, and happy, external pleasures such as good food,
clothing, and conversation make things even better, but their absence does not
overpower you.  If your mind is not peaceful and tamed, no matter how
marvelous the external circumstances are, you will be burdened by frights,
hopes, and fears.  With a tamed mind, you will enjoy wealth or poverty, health
or sickness, you can even die happily.  With a tamed mind, having many friends
is wonderful, but if you have no friends, it is all right, too.  The root of
your own happiness and welfare rests with a peaceful and tamed mind.

    One of the reasons there is a need to adopt a strong countermeasure
against someone who harms you is that, if you let it pass, there is a danger
of that person becoming habituated to extremely negative actions, which in the
long run will cause that person's own downfall and is very destructive for the
individual himself or herself.  Therefore a strong countermeasure, taken out
of compassion or a sense of concern for the other, is necessary.  When you are
motivated by that realization, then there is a sense of concern as part of
your motive for taking that strong measure.
    ...One of the reasons why there is some ground to feel compassionate
toward a perpetrator of crime or an aggressor is that the aggressor, because
he or she is perpetrating a crime, is at the causal stage, accumulating the
causes and conditions that later lead to undesirable consequences.  So, from
that point of view, there is enough ground to feel compassionate toward the
aggressor.

    What do you think would be the chief obstacle in recognizing that each
individual person has been kind to you?  In my case, I was afraid of having to
return the kindness, because then I'd be under the control of these people.  I
didn't want to do what my parents wanted me to do, although they gave me a lot
of slack--I left college after my first year, went to the woods of Vermont,
went to Tahiti, all on my own with whatever cash I earned.  I didn't fit into
the upper-middle-class community where we lived.  I didn't want their control;
the lifestyle they were pushing on me was completely unappealing.  Therefore,
I refused to recognize their kindness.
    However, assuming a debt with respect to every sentient being differs
greatly from having a debt to a few.  In this meditation, you start with
friends, then neutral persons, and then enemies and contemplate: "I will
return the debt of kindness that I have with this person through helping her
or him achieve happiness." It is easy to determine that the response to all
sentient beings' kindness cannot be to do everything they want, since, with so
many people, what they want from you would be at cross-purposes.  You cannot
even do everything your mother of this lifetime wants you to do, though you
know her advice is, for the most part, motivated by kindness....
    Those who help us--our parents, for instance--often attain power over us
for that very reason: "Do as I say because I have helped you."  Thus, for some,
it becomes almost a mental habit to refuse to recognize those who have helped
us, because they otherwise would attain some power over us.  Still, we know we
should return their many kindnesses.  That is one reason why the practice of
reflecting, "This person has helped me in many intimate ways and thus I must
do something in return," gets to be uncomfortable, but when it is extended to
more and more beings, we have to find a way of intending to return their
kindness without coming under their misguided influence.
    ...one cannot do everything all those sentient beings want.  There are so
many of them, and they want such contradictory things.  Besides, to fulfill
what they temporarily want may not be the best way to help them.  The greatest
of all ways to return their kindness is to help them become free from all
suffering and to assist in the process of becoming liberated from cyclic
existence and attaining the bliss of Buddhahood.  It is important to realize
here in the step of developing an intention to return others' kindness that
acknowledging a debt does not mean that you must do what they say.  Otherwise,
you might hold back from the truth of their attentive care.

    ...Nagarjuna's Fundamental Treatise says, "That which arises dependently
we explain as emptiness.  This [emptiness] is dependent designation; this is
the middle way."  His Refutation of Objections says, "I bow down to the
Buddha, the unequaled, supreme teacher, who taught that emptiness, dependent
arising, and the middle way hold a single meaning."
    For Tsong-kha-pa, the compatibility of emptiness and dependent arising is
the very heart of the Madhyamaka view and the key to the path.  Dependent
arising means that things come into being in dependence upon causes and
conditions.  Understanding dependent arising correctly refutes the idea that
things exist in and of themselves--because they must depend on other things.
In the same moment, it also refutes the nihilist extreme--because it shows
that things do arise, they do come into existence, and they affect one
another.  Thus, Tsong-kha-pa advises that if you think that you may have found
the profound view of emptiness, you should check to see if you have negated
too much.  Can this "emptiness" you have discovered be reconciled with the
mere existence of things that arise interdependently?  If not, then you are
certainly mistaken.
    ...The point is that one cannot become a buddha without both compassionate
action and nondual wisdom--and one cannot have these two types of path without
both of the two truths, conventional and ultimate.  If only emptiness existed
and there were, in fact, no conventional truths, then there would be no living
beings, no suffering to relieve; thus there would be no compassionate action;
and thus there would be no buddhahood.  Therefore, maintaining the
compatibility of the two truths--the compatibility of emptiness and dependent
arising--is crucial to the whole of the Dharma.

Anything that can be done chemically can be done by other means.

    ...let us discuss true sources of suffering.  The fact that sufferings are
not always produced but are produced in some places at some times and cease at
some times and in some places indicates that they are caused.  Logically, it
can be said that sufferings are caused because of being produced occasionally.
If sufferings were produced causelessly, either they would never exist or they
would always exist.
    Since sufferings are caused, one needs to look into what their causes are.
In the Buddhist systems, the causes are explained to be contaminated actions
and afflictive emotions....
    For instance, if I had an angry feeling, this could serve as a motivating
force that would lead to a harsh attitude, harsh speech, and harsh physical
gestures.  Since the anger that serves as the motivating factor is a
defIlement--an afflictive emotion--the physical and verbal actions done
through that motivating force are negative karmas, negative actions.  Through
them, the atmosphere immediately changes into one of tension.  Right away, I
might not feel the effects of those actions, perhaps even feeling that I had
gained a victory over someone, even shouting, "I have won." However, later I
will feel very sorry and shy, deep down experiencing a guilty conscience.
Similarly, those around me would immediately lose their tranquility and peace.
These are painful results of actions impelled by a bad motivation.  This is
the law of karma--motivation, action, result.
    Conversely, a good, open, sincere motivation such as compassion with a
deep respect for others impels verbal and physical actions that immediately
create a peaceful, harmonious, enjoyable atmosphere.  Due to that, I feel
happy and calm, enjoying that atmosphere, and others around me also enjoy the
same.  Therefore, bad motivation creates problems, suffering, and pain,
whereas good motivation creates happiness and peacefulness--something good.
    This is the general explanation.  On a deeper level, right at the time of
an action, predisposing potencies are instilled in the consciousness.  The
performance of an action establishes a predisposing potency in the mind that,
in the future, will serve as the causal condition for one's experiencing a
good or bad effect.

(Each day before breakfast the founder and abbess of Sravasti Abbey, Thubten
Chodron, gives a morning motivation for residents and guests.  Below is a
teaching given during March 2008.)

Quiet Place

    Have you ever had this experience?  You walk outside, and all of a sudden
the silence strikes you--it's in such sharp contrast to the chatter that's
going on in the mind.
    We live in a very quiet place.  We walk outside and it's pretty quiet--a
few birds chirping, sun shining.  Then suddenly the chatter in the mind stops
because we see that it's just chatter.  It's in such stark contrast to the
silence that's outside.
    We want to learn to notice that chatter before we even have to walk
outside.  And we want to be able to find that quiet place inside ourselves and
keep it with us, so that even when we're in a place where there is a lot of
noise, the mind can be quiet.
    All that mental chatter is basically negative conceptualization.  If we
were thinking about emptiness or developing compassion with that kind of
mental activity, fine!  Continue that outside, inside, everywhere.  But most
of the time what's going on is, "I like this.  I don't like this.  I want
this.  I don't want that.  Why does this person do this?  Why don't they do
that?"  That kind of mental activity makes the mind quite stressful as well
as accumulates negative karma and wastes a great deal of time.
    As soon as we can catch it and be aware of what's going on in our mind,
and come back to that silent space inside, the more peaceful we'll be.  Our
lives will be more productive in terms of having the Dharma grow in our
hearts, and we'll be more focused in whatever daily activities we're doing.
We won't be quite so distracted.

    ...if people have compassion, naturally that's something they can count
on; even if they have economic problems and their fortune declines, they still
have something to share with fellow human beings.  World economies are always
so tenuous and we are subject to so many losses in life, but a compassionate
attitude is something that we can always carry with us.
    ...Of course, in attempting to explain to someone the importance of
compassion, in some cases, you might be dealing with a very hardened,
individualistic, and selfish person, someone concerned only with her or his
own interests.  And it is even possible that there are people who may not have
the capacity to empathize with even someone whom they love or who may be close
to them.  But even to such people, it is still possible to present the
importance of compassion and love on the grounds that it's the best way to
fulfill their self-interests.  They wish to have good health, live a longer
life, and have peace of mind, happiness, and joy.  And if these are things
that they desire, I've heard that there is scientific evidence that these
things can be enhanced by feelings of love and compassion.
    ...educating someone about these facts and scientific studies could
certainly encourage some people to cultivate a more compassionate state of
mind.  But I think that, even aside from scientific studies, there are other
arguments that people could understand and appreciate from their own practical
or direct everyday experience.  For example, you could point out that lack of
compassion leads to a certain ruthlessness.  There are many examples
indicating that at some level deep down, ruthless people generally suffer from
a kind of unhappiness and discontent, people like Stalin and Hitler.  Such
people suffer from a kind of nagging sense of insecurity and fear.  Even when
they are sleeping I think that sense of fear remains...  these people lack
something that you can find in a more compassionate person--a sense of
freedom, a sense of abandonment, so when you sleep you can relax and let go.
Ruthless people never have that experience.  Something is always gripping
them; there is some kind of hold on them, and they aren't able to experience
that feeling of letting go, that sense of freedom.
    ...There are always different degrees of benefit that one might receive
from practicing various methods and techniques, depending on one's particular
circumstances....  First, through learning, thoroughly understanding the value
of compassion--this gives you a feeling of conviction and determination.
Then, employing methods to enhance empathy, such as using your imagination,
your creativity, to visualize yourself in another's situation.  And certain
exercises or practices that you can undertake, such as Tong-Len, serve to
strengthen your compassion.  But I think it's important to remember that these
techniques...  were developed to help as many as possible, at least some
portion of the human population.  But it was never expected that these
techniques could help 100 percent of people, the entire human population.
    ...the main point really, if we are talking about various methods to
develop compassion, the important thing is that people make a sincere effort
to develop their capacity for compassion.  If they make their best efforts to
be kinder, to cultivate compassion and make the world a better place, then at
the end of the day they can say, "At least I've done my best!"

    In ascertaining luminous clarity at the time of the path, the general
technique is to rest evenly in the very essence of luminous clarity.  Telopa
said:

        Rest relaxed within the uncontrived native state;
        Bonds are released and freedom is sure.

    This and other such instructions are expressed unanimously by the mighty
adepts.  Accordingly, with the body in the seven-point posture of meditative
stability, the mind rests without support, relaxed and uncontrived.  This will
create the unerring yogic direct perception of emptiness.  This is the
ultimate esoteric instruction of the completion phase found in the profound
tantras.  The reason is that once the vital points of the vajra body, which is
the support, are bound, the mind, eyes, and energy currents remain in a state
of nonthought.  Because of the special interconnection between body and mind,
the movement in the right and left channels is stopped and immobilized within
the central channel, causing the direct experience of mahamudra, emptiness
with aspects.
    Therefore the luminous mind, which is the supported, is realized as empty
appearance arising as the mahamudra of forms of emptiness.  This, again,
depends on the dissolution of the energy currents of the right and left
channels in the central channel, the supreme support.  There is no more
profound method for affecting this dissolution than resting the mind once it
is uncontrived and relaxed.  Therefore, in all the esoteric instructions of
highest tantra, this is called "the esoteric instruction of withdrawal" in the
presentations.

    To solve the problems humanity is facing, we need to organize meetings of
scholars, educators, social workers, neuroscientists, physicians, and experts
from all fields to discuss the positive and negative sides of what we have
done thus far, as well as what needs to be introduced and what needs to be
changed in our educational system.  Proper environment plays a crucial role in
the healthy growth of a child.  All problems, including terrorism, can be
overcome through education, particularly by introducing concern for all others
at the preschool level.
    Living in society, we must share the suffering of our fellow citizens and
practice compassion and tolerance not only toward our loved ones but also
toward our enemies.  This is the test of our moral strength.  We must set an
example by our own practice.  We must live by the same high standards of
integrity we seek to convey to others.  The ultimate purpose is to serve and
benfit the world.

    "When Tibet was still free, we cultivated our natural isolation,

    Persons from orally oriented cultures, writes Ong, tend to project their
sensibilities, to see them expressed in the world around them.  More widely
literate cultures create persons who tend to withdraw for insight into their
own personal psyches.  Orally oriented peoples may thus be more inclined than
persons in print-dominated cultures to set their feelings or experiences in
the space around them, including the invisible spirits presumed to occupy that
space, and less likely to project these feelings and experiences onto
individual persons.  In Tibet lineages or sects are the most likely targets of
negative projections.  Western print-oriented persons are more likely to
project their feelings onto other individuals, especially people in
significant relationships with them.  Unlike Tibet, or the premodern West, the
contemporary West tends to identify the mind as the exclusive locus of ideas,
feelings, and values.  With this localization, the mind becomes "psychic" in a
new sense, distinct from bodily soma and from the larger world.
    This very different configuration of personhood affects the way Westerners
are likely to understand the Great Bliss Queen practice.  For example, there
is a tendency among Westerners for "visualization" to be a more disembodied
practice than it is for Tibetans.  The point in imagining oneself as the Great
Bliss Queen is not just to replace one visual image of oneself with another,
as if observing a changing scene in a movie theater, but to experience a
physical as well as mental shift from deep inside the body.

    ...when you recognize how kind someone has been to you, you are using an
ordinary worldly attitude to help keep you from responses of hatred.  For
instance, if someone gave me a grant with a blank check to form a team of
translators of Tibetan thought, I would be more than extremely pleased.  Now
if the person who gave me the money came by someday and gave me a hard time, I
would feel a measure of restraint due to reflecting on the person's kindness.
I would seek other means to work things out with the person.  When you reflect
how kind every person has been, there is that restraint to the point where,
believe it or not, trained Buddhists will look at a fly or an ant walking
across the table and think, "This is someone who bore me in her womb in a
former lifetime, who took care of me."
    If you watch how mothers take precautions for a child in the womb, it is
clear that they do a great deal to help it.  They eat nourishing foods and
avoid harmful substances like coffee, alcohol, nicotine, and drugs.  If you
reflect on how such a mother takes care of the child in the womb and extend
this reflection to all sentient beings, I think that because your field of
awareness is no longer just a few sentient beings but is gradually expanding
to more and more, you can reflect on the mother's kindness without doing it
merely because you were helped.  The staggering debt deflates your sense of
exaggerated importance.  The boil is pricked.

    Buddha's teachings on non-manifest phenomena, such as the extremely subtle
presentations of actions and their effect--which are very hidden phenomena--
cannot be proved with reasoning.  How then can they be verified?
    There is no need to verify manifest phenomena through reasoning because
they appear directly to the senses.  The slightly hidden, however, can be
proved with reasoning that generates inferential understanding, and since
emptiness is very profound but only slightly hidden, it is accessible to
reasoning.
    ...very hidden phenomena cannot be proved with reasoning, and it seems
that Buddha can say whatever he likes.  However, through our own experience we
can confirm Buddha's teachings on more important topics such as emptiness, the
altruistic mind of enlightenment, love, and compassion, for no matter who
analyses--Buddhist or non-Buddhist--or how much one analyses, if the person is
not biased through desire or hatred, these teachings can bear analysis and
serve as powerful sources of thought.  When you see that Buddha does not err
with regard to these more important phenomena, you can accept his other
presentations.
    ...The process of cyclic existence and the eradication of it can be proved
by the reasoning that establishes the misconception of inherent existence as
its root cause and establishes the wisdom cognising emptiness as its antidote.

Meditation on [or cultivation of] the six deities is like faith or love
meditation in that the mind is being generated into the entity of the object
meditated.  When faith or love are meditated, those two are not the object
observed but the entity into which the consciousness is being generated.
Meditation on impermanence or emptiness, on the other hand, means to take
these as the object and meditate on them.  Thus, there are two types of
meditation--of a subjective aspect and on an objective aspect.  Meditation on
the six deities is the former, for first one generates a wisdom consciousness
knowing the sameness in suchness of oneself and the deity--the ultimate--and
then causes it to appear as the sounds, letters, and finally the form of the
deity.

    Once we realize emptiness, all phenomena are included within this reality,
which is not separate from the cause and effect of karma and which is free of
mental constructs.  On this ultimate level of realization, it is possible to
state that there is no wholesome or unwholesome action.  When we have realized
the nature of all phenomena, negative actions naturally subside and positive
ones are spontaneously accomplished.  Until this time, however, we would be
slipping into nihilism if we said that the phenomena of relative truth, such
as positive and negative actions or karma, do not exist.
    Just knowing this authentic view, however, is not enough.  For others to
be able to experience it, we must also know the scriptures and reasonings so
that we can teach.  Without the support of this knowledge, it will be
difficult for others to trust what we say, and so Milarepa speaks of scripture
and reasoning as an adornment to realization.

        Dissolving thoughts into the dharmakaya--
        Is this not meditation naturally arising?
        Join it with experience
        To make it beautifully adorned.

    One way to understand meditation is to see it as a practice of working
with the many thoughts that arise in our mind.  With realization they arise as
mere appearances of the dharmakaya, the natural arising of mind's essential
nature.  Being clear about this true nature of thought is called "attaining
the level of natural arising." At this point, there is no difference in any
thought that may arise, because we see the nature of each thought to be
emptiness, arising as the dharmakaya.  Meditation could be defined as
realizing the dharmakaya of the Buddha.

        Mindfulness of the spiritual instructions
        learned through study and contemplation.
          -- The Seventh Dalai Lama

    Ordinary friends desert us when we fall on hard times or become an
inconvenience in their lives.  Others simply disappear into their own
destinies.  Even our spiritual teachers eventually die and leave us behind.
    Our practice of the Dharma, however, that has been cultivated by means of
study, contemplation and meditation, is the one sure anchor that keeps our
ship stable when the seas become choppy.  In fact, the more difficult the
situation we encounter, the more helpful it is to us.
    When the Buddha had become very old and was preparing to pass away,
several of his disciples were overcome with grief.  They asked him, "What
will we do after you are gone?"  He replied, "Whenever you rely upon my
teachings, at that time I am there with you."
    The Second Dalai Lama wrote, "When we know how to rely on the Dharma, we
are able to be happy in every situation.  Where could one find a more

as scientists, you have a special responsibility.  Besides your own
profession, you have a basic motivation to serve humanity, to try to produce
better, happier human beings.  Whether we understand consciousness or not, we
must produce warm-hearted persons.  That is important.  I want to express
that.  Whenever I meet scientists, I always have to say this.
    Through my own profession, I try my best to contribute as much as I can.
This proceeds without my being concerned whether another person agrees with my
philosophy or not.  Some people may be very much against my belief, my
philosophy, but I feel alright.  So long as I see that a human being suffers
or has needs, I shall contribute as much as I can to contribute to their
benefit.  Scientists and medically qualified people can contribute especially.
That's different; that's a particular context.  A human being needs to be
cared for according to your professional calling.  You can contribute; that's

    ...while walking in a park the body may be in the park while the mind is
off working in the office, or at home, or talking to a distant friend, or
making a list of groceries.  That means the mind has disconnected from the
body.  Instead, when looking at a flower, really look at it.  Be fully
present.  With the help of the flower, bring the mind back to the park.
Appreciation for sensory experience reconnects mind and body.  When the
experience of the flower is felt throughout the body, a healing occurs; this
can be the same when seeing a tree, smelling smoke, feeling the cloth of your
shirt, hearing a bird call, or tasting an apple.  Train yourself to vividly
experience sensory objects without judgment.  Try completely to be the eye
with form, the nose with smell, the ear with sound, and so on.  Try to be
complete in experience while remaining in just the bare awareness of the
sensory object.
    When this ability is developed, reactions will still occur.  Upon seeing
the flower, judgements about its beauty will arise, or a smell may be judged
to be foul.  Even so, with practice the connection to the pure sensory
experience can be maintained rather than continuing to become lost in the
mind's distraction.  Being distracted by a cloud of concepts is a habit and it
can be replaced with a new habit: using bodily sensual experience to bring us
to presence, to connect us to the beauty of the world, to the vivid and
nourishing experience of life that lies under our distractions.  This is the
underpinning of successful dream yoga.

    To succeed in practicing any form of tantra, it is necessary first to
train in developing the altruistic intention to become enlightened.  Dzong-
ka-ba says that this needs to be done "in accordance with the quintessential
instructions," these being found in his Great Exposition of the Stages of the
Path to Enlightenment.  Specifically, such an altruistic intention is
generated by way of the seven cause and effect quintessential instructions or
the equalizing and switching of self and other.  To do those, it is necessary
to identify what liberation is and to develop an awareness seeking liberation,
for which it is necessary to reflect on the three types of suffering and
develop an intention to turn away from over-emphasizing the appearances of
this life and then to turn away from over-emphasizing the appearances of
future lives, developing an intention to leave such cyclic existence entirely,
whereupon it is possible to reflect on how others suffer and develop
compassion.  Done continuously over a long period of time, at best one should
develop a fully qualified altruistic intention to become enlightened, and at
least one should develop such an intention from the depths of the heart.
    With such altruism as your basic motivation it is possible to receive
initiation and take the pledges that lay out a type of behavior conducive to
enlightenment.
    ...nowadays some people look on the practice of religion as if it were
something that causes them to lose their freedom.  Opposite to this, rules
[for controlling counter-productive ill-deeds and overcoming afflictive
emotions] are for the sake of utilizing your freedom to develop the limitless
qualities of Buddhahood, in the quest for which you should never be satisfied.
Toward material things, which necessarily have a limit, it is best to be
satisfied with what you have, but with regard to the limitless development of
spiritual qualities, you should never be satisfied with a mere portion, but
continually seek higher development.  The rules themselves make your mind
conducive to such progress, so there is no reason to be uptight about them.

    The practice of Dzogchen may begin with doing fixation on an object, in
order to calm one's thoughts.  Then one relaxes the fixation, dissolving the
dependence on the object, and one fixes one's gaze in open space.  Then, when
one succeeds in making the calm state stable, it is important to work with the
movement of one's thoughts and one's energy, integrating this movement with
the presence of contemplation.  At this point one is ready to apply
contemplation in one's daily life.  The system of practice just described is
characteristic of the Series of the Nature of the Mind, but that is not to say
that in Dzogchen one must necessarily begin with fixation and meditation on a
calm state.  In the Series of Primordial Space, and the Series of Secret
Instructions, for example, one enters directly into the practice of
contemplation.  Particularly in the former, there are very precise
instructions on how to find the pure state of contemplation.  In the latter,
on the other hand, the explanations are mainly concerned with how one
continues in contemplation in all circumstances.
    The practice of contemplation is concisely explained in the line that
reads, "but vision nevertheless manifests: all is good."  Even if the
condition of "what is" cannot be grasped with the mind, the whole
manifestation of the primordial state, including our karmic vision, does
nevertheless exist.  All the various aspects of forms, colours, and so on,
continue to arise without interruption.  When we find ourselves in
contemplation, this doesn't mean that our impure vision just disappears
and pure vision manifests instead.  If we have a physical body, there is a
karmic cause for that, so there would be no sense in trying to abandon or
deny the situation we find ourselves in.  We just need to be aware of it.
If we have a vision of the material, physical level of existence, which is
the cause of so very many problems, we need to understand that this vision
is only the gross aspect of the colours, which are the essence of the elements.

Don't think there are no crocodiles because the water is calm.

    A tantric yogi who has gained control of the subtle energies of the body
and the subtle levels of consciousness will have control over the inner and
outer elements and consequently can transform his or her ordinary samsaric
form into a joyous rainbow body.  But until we can do this, we have to accept
the fact that our physical basis is a magnet attracting every kind of
discomfort and pain.
    ...This samsaric body keeps us running all of our lives.  We have to run
to fulfill its endless needs, to keep it away from things that may harm it,
and to protect it from anything unpleasant.  We have to give it pleasure and
comfort.  We become ordained, and at first this is very satisfactory; but soon
our body makes it so difficult for us that we think our practice would be less
disturbed if we were to live as a layperson.  So we give up and return to
ordinary life; but then we end up with a family to support, leaving us with no
time or energy for meditation.  We have the pressing tasks of feeding,
clothing, and sheltering our children, and of arranging their education and so
forth.  Our lives are spent alternating between work and worry, with
occasional short periods of pleasure, and then we have to die; but even this
we cannot do in peace, for, when we lie down to die, our last thoughts are
worried ones concerning the family we are leaving behind.  Such is the nature
of worldly existence.
    ...To care for our old people--these ones who have given us our body, our
life, and our culture--is a sacred duty of humanity.  But most humans act more
like animals than people, and often we see old people who have been abandoned
by their families.  Family units were very strong in Tibet, and old people
were usually cared for directly by relatives.  The national care for the old
that we see in the West is something very good, a healthy sign, although
perhaps here the spiritual and psychological basis is somewhat lacking.
    The suffering of old age is something we all must face, unless we die
prematurely.  There is nothing we can do about it.  Gone will be that false
sense of personal ability and strength that made us so proud when we were
young.  Instead, helpers or friends will bathe us, dress us, spoonfeed us, and
have to take us to the toilet.  Rather than live under the delusion of
permanence, we should engage in spiritual training so that we can enter old
age at least with the grace of wisdom.
    ...So we can see that this body indeed causes us much grief in this life
and, sadly, in their quest to satisfy its many needs, most people just collect
an endless stream of negative karmic instincts that will lead them to lower
rebirths in the future.  These are the sufferings of the human world.
    ...The important point here is to become aware of the third type of
suffering, the subtle suffering that pervades all imperfect existence, the
all-pervading misery concomitant with having a perishable, samsaric base....
[All are] enmeshed in suffering because the nature of their body and mind is
bound with compulsive cyclic processes.  Until we develop the wisdom that is
able to free the mind from these compelling forces, there is no doubt that we
shall experience suffering throughout our lives, and that we shall continue to
wander endlessly in the wheel of birth, life, death, and rebirth where the
presence of misery can always be felt.

Observing the Mind Itself

    The primary meditative technique of great perfection is remaining in the
state of pure awareness.  This is accomplished by calming the mind and then
abiding in comprehension of its basic clear light nature.  The meditative
practice involves being cognizant of the arising and passing away of feelings,
emotions, sensations, etc., but understanding them within the context of pure
awareness.  The more one does this, the more one realizes that all phenomena
arise from mind and remerge into it.  They are of the nature of pure awareness
and are a projection of luminosity and emptiness.  Through cultivating this
understanding, mental phenomena of their own accord begin to subside, allowing
the clear light nature of mind to become manifest.  They appear as reflections
on the surface of a mirror and are perceived as illusory, ephemeral, and
nonsubstantial.
    Those who succeed in this practice attain a state of radical freedom:
there are no boundaries, no presuppositions, and no habits on which to rely.
One perceives things as they are in their naked reality.  Ordinary beings view
phenomena through a lens clouded by concepts and preconceptions, and most of
the world is overlooked or ignored.  The mind of the great perfection adept,
however, is unbounded, and everything is possible.  For many beginners, this
prospect is profoundly disquieting, because since beginningless time we have
been constricted by rules, laws, assumptions, and previous actions.  One who
is awakened, however, transcends all such limitations; there is no ground on
which to stand, no limits, nothing that must be done, and no prohibitions.
This awareness is bottomless, unfathomable, immeasurable, permeated by joy,
unboundedness, and exhilaration.  One is utterly free, and one's state of mind
is as expansive as space.  Those who attain this level of awareness also
transcend physicality and manifest the "rainbow body" ('ja lus), a form
comprising pure light that cannot decay, which has no physical aspects, and
which is coterminous with the nature of mind.

    Among Tibetans, at least traditionally, the economic conditions are such
that this nine-to-five daily employment isn't really an important part of
[working life].  In Tibet, either you are a farmer or a nomad or a merchant.
The work is seasonal....  During the season they work very hard, and when they
finish they come back and don't have any employment.
    ...in modern society, and particularly in industrialized nations, the
issue of unemployment is a very difficult situation.  There are no easy
answers.  One has no choice but to try to cope, and make one's best effort to
find new work.  There is just no other solution.
    However, the basic attitude of the individual plays a very significant
role, and can make a big difference in how someone responds.  While we may not
have control over our situation, our attitude is something that we have some
control over.  So first, what we need to realize is that uncertainty and
change are very much a part of the modern economy, particularly with regard to
employment.  That is a serious problem, but a fact that we have to accept.
There is no guarantee that there will be a job tomorrow if you are working
today.  So, if we understand this ahead of time, it may change how we respond
when that happens.  Then we won't feel so surprised, as if we are singled out.
We understand that the loss of a job has many factors, the result of many
causes and conditions.  We will understand that, in many cases, it may even
have roots in global economic issues.  This way, we won't become so upset by
taking it personally, or looking around us for someone to blame for our
problems.  This alone may help reduce our mental agitation.  Of course, here
we are talking about unemployment due to some wider causes or layoffs, not due
to being fired because of one's own incompetence.
    So there might be different ways in which individuals will respond to the
challenges of change.  What is important is to acknowledge this fact and try
to work out how best to cope with the immediate problem itself.  For example,
if you need employment as a means of your livelihood and if you become
unemployed, then all your efforts should be put into looking for new
employment so that your livelihood will be secure.  But there are two
different responses.  One person may feel demoralized and become sort of
paralyzed, thinking, There is no hope, I lost my job, what am I supposed to
do?  But another individual in the same situation might look at it as an
opportunity to make some changes.  As a challenge.  So that is the more
positive way, the more proactive way of dealing with this problem.  But of
course it is not easy.
    There may also be other ways that might help at least reduce the mental
anxiety of dealing with the situation, so that a person can use all their
mental energy to find new work.  For Buddhists, there are certain thought
processes and considerations that help--for example, the belief in karma
[one's actions] and ultimately taking responsibility for one's own karma.
Although this kind of mental attitude may not have any effect in physically
resolving the situation, at least it will help ease the individual from the
psychological effect of losing the job, and so on.  And of course, believers
in other religious systems can also take some consolation in their own
beliefs.

    Compassion and love are not man-made.  Ideology is man-made, but
compassion and love are produced by nature.  It is important to recognize
natural qualities, especially when we face a problem and fail to find a
solution.  For example... in religious business, sometimes even due to
religion, we create a problem.  If we try to solve that problem using
religious methods, it is quite certain that we will not succeed.  So I feel
that when we face those kinds of problems, it is important to return to our
basic human quality.  Then I think we will find that solutions come easier.
Therefore, I usually say that the best way to solve human problems is with
human understanding.
    It is very important to recognize the basic nature of humanity and the
value of human qualities.  Whether one is educated or uneducated, rich or
poor, or belongs to this nation or that nation, this religion or that
religion, this ideology or that ideology, is secondary and doesn't matter.
When we return to this basis, all people are the same.  Then we can truly say
the words brother, sister; then they are not just nice words--they have some
meaning.  That kind of motivation automatically builds the practice of
kindness.  This gives us inner strength.
    ...Next, let us talk about the human being as a social animal.  Even if we
do not like other people, we have to live together.  Natural law is such that
even bees and other animals have to live together in cooperation.  I am
attracted to bees because I like honey--it is really delicious.  Their product
is something that we cannot produce, very beautiful, isn't it?  I exploit them
too much, I think.  Even these insects have certain responsibilities, they
work together very nicely.  They have no constitution, they have no law, no
police, nothing, but they work together effectively.  This is because of
nature.  Similarly, each part of a flower is not arranged by humans but by
nature.  The force of nature is something remarkable.  We human beings, we
have constitutions, we have law, we have a police force, we have religion, we
have many things.  But in actual practice, I think that we are behind those
small insects.
    Sometimes civilization brings good progress, but we become too involved
with this progress and neglect or forget about our basic nature.  Every
development in human society should take place on the basis of the foundation
of the human nature.  If we lose that basic foundation, there is no point in
such developments taking place.

    Emphasizing neither renunciation nor transformation, though incorporating
both into its preparatory practices, the Great Completeness provides a
method know as "self-liberation" (rang 'grol), sometimes described as
"liberation in its own spot" (rang sar 'grol).  Liberation takes place in the
situation just as it is, because one's mind and all things are, despite
powerful appearances to the contrary, primordially pure.  If one has not yet
made this essential discovery, the Great Bliss Queen ritual can prepare one
for it.  If one is familiar with the Great Completeness perspective, one
performs the visualization and recitation of the Great Bliss Queen ritual
entirely within an experience of innate awareness.  In either case, the ritual
encompasses the three nondualisms already discussed.
    One way of accessing the primordial purity so important to the Great
Completeness tradition is a practice known as "pure vision."  This involves
visualizing companions, family, surroundings, and so forth as creations of
light, the habitat of an enlightened being.  From the viewpoint of the Great
Completeness, such pure vision is not an imaginative overlay, but a move
toward understanding things as they are.  As Khetsun Sangpo taught it, this
practice allows you to understand that apparently ordinary things and persons
have "been [primordially pure] from the beginning" so that "you are
identifying their own proper nature.  Your senses normally misrepresent what
is there, but through this visualization you can come closer to what actually
exists."  In short, by identifying one's body, companions, and world with
those of the Great Bliss Queen, one develops the ability to discover what has
always been there.  This being so, there is no need to renounce or change
anything, only to see it more completely.  This is the Great Completeness
tradition's special mix of ontological and cognitive nondualisms.  Unlike the
tantric traditions, in which it is necessary to cease the coarse sense and
mental consciousness in order for the most subtle mind of clear light to
appear, the Dalai Lama observes that "in the Old [Nyingma] Translation School
of the Great Completeness it is possible to be introduced to the clear light
without the cessation of the six operative consciousnesses."  Hence the
possibility of "discovering" what is already in our midst.  Such discovery
reveals a spontaneous presence (yon dan hlun gyis grub ba) of collateral
qualities such as clarity and spontaneous responsiveness.  Thus, comments
Longchen Rabjam, "primordially pure primordial wisdom is free in the face of
thought and the primordial wisdom, with a nature of spontaneity, abides as
primordial radiance, and profound clarity."

    Why is it that meeting our yidam deity directly and receiving the deity's
blessing are so important?  If we are studying texts and wish to become great
scholars, there are an inconceivable number of the Buddha's teachings along
with the treatises that comment on them.  All these have to be studied
diligently so that we can come to a basic understanding of their meaning;
beyond this, it is extremely difficult to enter into the more subtle levels.
In all of this practice and study, it is our own mind that is central.
Without a great blessing or without awakening the generative power of previous
habitual patterns, it will be extremely difficult to realize primordial
wisdom.
    Lord Maitreya stated that bodhisattvas abiding on the various levels are
not able to attain omniscience immediately, and he also affirmed that we do
not need to become expert in all five traditional Buddhist sciences.  Among
these are all classifications of the inner science that deals with the mind.
In the practice of the Secret Mantrayana, it is said that as long as objects
continue to arise in our minds, so long will the classifications of the Secret
Mantrayana last.  As long as we have not realized the simultaneity of concepts
and liberation, as long as we have not been blessed with the knowledge that
knowing the nature of one phenomenon liberates us into knowing the nature of
all, we need to train from lifetime to lifetime in the many aspects of the
teachings.  If we try to become expert in all five sciences or try to know all
the objects of knowledge, our training will be endless.  For these reasons, it
is extremely important to seek accomplishments and blessings from the yidam
deity, for through the blessing of the deity, our positive habitual patterns
from the past will be awakened and the doubts that cloud our minds will be
cleared away.

       Verse 6
       When someone whom I have helped
       Or in whom I have placed great hopes
       Mistreats me in extremely hurtful ways
       May I regard him still as my precious teacher.
         -- Shantideva, "Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life"

    According to worldly norms of human behaviour, when we help someone and
place great trust in them and they mistreat us in return, it is seen as
reasonable to be angry with them because we have been hurt.  However,
practitioners of bodhicitta must not give in to this type of conventional
thinking.  Instead, we should learn to view such people in a special way, as
objects for our practice of forbearance and loving kindness.  We must in fact
recognise these people as our spiritual teachers.

    Advanced meditators develop the ability to create environments of their
own choosing, and they are able to transcend the sufferings that seem so real
to ordinary beings who are bound by mundane conceptions.  According to Tsong
Khapa, for one who attains advanced levels of meditation, painful cognitions
no longer occur, no matter what external experiences one encounters.  All of
one's cognitions are a union of bliss and emptiness.  One recognizes that
nothing is inherently what it appears to be.  Whatever occurs is perceived by
one's unshakably blissful consciousness as the sport of luminosity and
emptiness, and so,

      "for a Bodhisattva who has attained the meditative stabilisation of
      bliss pervading all phenomena, only a feeling of pleasure arises with
      respect to all objects; pain and neutrality do not occur, even though
      [pieces from his body] the size of a small coin are cut or even though
      his body is crushed by elephants, only a discrimination of bliss is
      maintained."
        -- Tsong-ka-pa on Ratnarakshita's Commentary

    Tantric texts stress that such bodhisattvas are not creating a delusional
system in order to hide from the harsher aspects of reality.  Rather, they are
transforming reality, making it conform to an ideal archetype.  Since all
phenomena are empty of inherent existence, they have no fixed nature.  No one
ever apprehends an object as it is in its true nature, because there is no
such nature.  Even if phenomena had fixed essences, we would still never be
able to perceive them, since all we ever experience are our cognitions of
objects, which are overlaid with conceptions about them.  All our perceptions
are ideas about things, and not real things.  These ideas are also empty,
arising from nothingness and immediately dissolving again into nothingness,
leaving nothing behind.  Tantric adepts develop the ability to reconstitute
"reality," which is completely malleable for those who train in yogas
involving blissful consciousnesses realizing emptiness.  The sense of bliss
pervades all their cognitions, and their understanding of emptiness allows
them to generate minds that are manifestations of bliss and emptiness.

    For those of you who are not able to devote all your time to meditation,
there is nevertheless the possibility of engaging in practice in a serious
way.  For example, the students at the monastic universities in South India
can, with some effort, do meditations during the prayers.  When you recite the
prayers, you can mentally do the contemplation.  The lifestyle and daily
routine at these monasteries have been structured by the great masters of the
past in a way that is most conducive to individual practice as well as to the
flourishing of the dharma.
    If you find that your mind is in a very fluctuating emotional state--
displaying anger, hatred, attachment and so forth--then you should first try
to calm down that state of strong emotion.  This should be done by first
transforming it into a neutral state of mind, because there is no way that one
can switch directly from a negative state of mind to a positive one.
Therefore, you should first reduce the force of these emotions and
fluctuations and try to bring about some sort of calmness, using any means--
such as taking a stroll or concentrating on the inhalation and exhalation of
the breath--that will enable you to forget what you are immediately feeling.
This will help you to reduce the force of strong emotion, thereby giving you
the calmness necessary for the practice of dharma.  Like a white piece of
cloth which could be dyed any color that you desire, such a neutral state of
mind could then be transformed into a virtuous state of mind.
    You could also engage in the preliminary practices of performing 100,000
prostrations, recitations of the Vajrasattva mantra, and so forth.  When you
undertake these practices, you should do them properly, not being only
concerned about the number.  Many great masters of the past of all traditions
have emphasized the importance of these preliminary practices--they will
enable you to have a very firm start.  If through them you can acquire a
fertile mind, then when the seed of meditation is planted, it will readily
bear the fruits of realizations.
    Having successfully neutralized the emotional fluctuations within your
mind and having restored a reasonable degree of calmness, engage in the
practice of taking refuge and generating the altruistic aspiration to attain
full enlightenment.  Taking refuge in the Three Jewels is the factor that
distinguishes one's practice from that of an erroneous path, and the
generation of the altruistic mind makes it superior to the paths aiming at
individual liberation.

    ...if you consider just the subtlest mind and the wind or energy that
serves as its mount, the mere factor of luminosity and knowing of the subtlest
mind itself as well as the energy associated with it are what will be
transformed into the mind and body of a Buddha.  This is the mind that will
turn into an omniscient consciousness--a Buddha's mind; it is this mind which
will be transformed, not some other mind coming from the outside.  In other
words, the Buddha nature is inherent; it is not imported from somewhere else.
    This is true because the very entity of the mind, its nature of mere
luminosity and knowing, is not polluted by defilements; they do not abide in
the entity of the mind.  Even when we generate afflictive emotions, the very
entity or nature of the mind is still mere luminosity and knowing, and because
of this we are able to remove the afflictive emotions.

    The recognition that worldly attainments just do not provide enduring
happiness, and that we need to work on the internals, rather than the
externals, is an important motivation.  It is also the basis of achieving
nirvana, often represented by the lotus flower.  It is no accident that most
statues of Buddha have him sitting on cushions resting on a lotus flower--the
symbol of renunciation.
    But what if we achieve nirvana?  What if, through extreme diligence, we
attain its supreme peace and happiness?  Would that be enough, or is there a
more profound level of motivation still?
    Some years ago a number of tourists were kidnapped by terrorists in the
Philippines, and held hostage in the jungle for many months.  Finally they
were released in small groups.  I will never forget the reaction of one
hostage who was interviewed at the airport on his way home to join his wife,
who had been freed just days earlier.
    You would think that after months of extreme privation and the constant
threat of uncertainty and death, returning safely to one's wife, home, and
family would be a cause for joyful celebration.  But the hostage, while
relieved, could only think of the group of hostages he'd left behind.  Those
who, in the preceding months, had been his fellow prisoners, whom he now knew
better than anyone else, and with whom in several cases, he had formed unique
and profound bonds of attachment.  His overriding concern was to ensure that
those still being held captive would be safely released to experience the same
freedom he had now.  Only then would he really be able to celebrate.

    The term "meditation" carries with it a burden of trendy, pseudo-mystical
connotations.  The biggest mistake people make is to think that they will "get
something" out of meditation.  It would be more accurate to think they will be
getting rid of something.  Awareness practice undermines our unwitting
subjugation to hypermentation.  It cuts through the cascade of thoughts and
feelings that distract us from the present moment where life actually happens.
The inner newsreel, with its imagined or distorted dramas, becomes less urgent
and seductive.  The unexamined hopes and fears that have thrown us into
automatic or reflexive behavior lose their power to toss us about.  What we
get rid of, initially, is a great deal of compelling noise with no point or
real substance to it.  Even by becoming aware of its nature we de-reify it,
render it less solid and intractable.
    ...How can we sort out our neuroses when the mind is a wild, chaotic mess
of fragmented thought?  How can we work with our anger when we experience it
as a deluge of highly charged, urgent impulses, all mixed in with fleeting
bits of narrative, physical sensations, whispers of memory, rushes of fear,
and the visceral press to act?  We can't.  Every beginning meditator discovers
very quickly that the mind has a mind of its own.  No beginner sits down,
says, "Peace!  Be still!" and accomplishes enlightenment.  It's enough at the
start just to see, discover, and acknowledge the chatter.  That, in itself, is
a great step towards self-awareness.  Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche taught that the
awareness of our confusion is the first step towards clarity.
    Over time, we can learn to just take note of whatever arises without being
pushed and pulled emotionally.  We can sit still and not respond reflexively
to our hypermentation.  We can allow ourselves to rest, to gently release
thoughts, to find a quiet space apart from the discursive jumble.  We can
choose to be simply and quietly aware.  In these quiet moments, experiences
arise much more clearly and distinctly.  Only then can we discover the source
of our suffering and our anger.
    I once attended a conference between a highly esteemed Tibetan lama,
Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, and a group of psychiatrists.  Someone asked
Rinpoche: "What is meditation?"  Rinpoche looked playfully puzzled, pretended
not to understand, and after a brief consultation with his translator,
answered: "Meditation?  Meditation?  I don't know what that means.  We have
another word for it which means 'paying attention to.' " Whatever the style,
to meditate is to pay attention.

    ...practice must be carried out in terms of one's own thought.  If one
knows how to bring the teachings into one's own thought, all physical and
verbal deeds can be made to accord with practice.  If one does not know how to
bring them into one's own thought, even though one might meditate, recite
scriptures, or spend one's life in a temple, it will not help; thought is
therefore important for practice.  Thus, taking refuge in the Three Jewels
(Buddha, his Doctrine and the Spiritual Community), taking into account the
relationship between actions and their effects, and generating an attitude of
helping others, are most important.

    Formerly in Tibet there was a famous lama called Drom.  One day Drom saw a
man walking around a reliquary.  'Walking around a reliquary is good,' he
said.  'Practice is even better.' The man thought, 'Then, reading a holy book
would be good.' He did so, and one day while he was reading, Drom saw him and
said, 'Reading a holy book is good; practice is even better.'

    The man thought, 'This also does not seem to be sufficient.  Now if I do
some meditation, that will certainly be practice.' Drom saw him in meditation
and said, 'Meditation is good; practice is even better.' The man was amazed
and asked, 'How does one practise?' Drom answered, 'Do not be attached to this
life; cause your mind to become the practices.' Dram said this because
practice depends on thought.

    They meet the liberating path, but doubting and striving, they part from
it!
    Doubting if they should refrain from their ill-omened actions, they

force.
    If one considers the sufferings of the six realms in terms of oneself, one
has no time to remain ordinary.
    When one sees that the characteristic of samsara is suffering, a mind
wanting nothing whatsoever is born!
    When one sees the various bases as rootless, self-grasping is not born!
    When impermanence is born in the mind, faith and perseverance will come
together!

things as real!

    In Buddhism there are basically two types of practices: Sutra and
Tantra....  The special purpose of Tantra is to provide a faster path so that
qualified practitioners can be of service to others more quickly.  In Tantra
the power of imagination is harnessed to meditation in a practice called deity
yoga.  In this practice you imagine 1) replacing your mind as it ordinarily
appears, full of troubling emotions, with a mind of pure wisdom motivated by
compassion; 2) substituting your body as it ordinarily appears (composed of
flesh, blood, and bone) with a body fashioned from compassionately motivated
wisdom; 3) developing a sense of a pure self that depends on purely appearing
mind and body in an ideal environment, fully engaged in helping others.  As
this distinctive practice of Tantra calls for visualizing yourself with a
Buddha's body, activities, resources, and surroundings, it is called "taking
imagination as the spiritual path."
    Let us consider a qualm about this practice.  You are considering yourself
to have Buddha qualities which you presently do not have.  Is this, then, a
correct type of meditative consciousness?  Yes.  Your mind is involved in
understanding reality, out of which you are appearing as a deity.  Therefore,
your mind, from this viewpoint, is correct.  Also, you are purposely imagining
yourself as having a divine body even if you do not presently possess one.
This is an imaginative meditation; you are not convinced from the depths that
you actually have pure mind, body, and selfhood.  Rather, based in clear
imagination of ideal body and mind, you are cultivating the sense of being a
deity, compassionately helping others.
    ...to engage in Tantra at any level demands a powerful intention to become
enlightened for the sake of others, and a feeling that this needs to be done
very quickly.

     Life", translated and edited by Jeffrey Hopkins

Why do we want to be wise and compassionate?  If it's because we would simply
like to be wise and compassionate, we are off course, because the "I" cannot
attain wisdom and compassion.  Wisdom and compassion can only be revealed once
the "I" has disappeared.  When we reach this level, we will be able to benefit
others.  In the meantime, it is the blind leading the blind.  All true
religions seek to gain access to that level of consciousness which is not ego-
bound.  In Buddhism, it is called the unconditioned, the unborn, the
deathless.  You can call it anything you like.  You can call it atman.  You
can call it anatman.  You can call it God.  The fact is, there is a subtle
level of consciousness which is the core of our being, and it is beyond our
ordinary conditioned state of mind.  We can all experience this.  Some people
experience it through service, others through devotion.  Some even think they
can experience it through analysis and intellectual discipline.  Buddhists
usually try to access it through meditation.  That's what we are doing.
Breaking through to the unconditioned in order to help others break through to
the unconditioned.  But we have to start where we are, from right here.  We
start with these minds, these bodies, these problems, these weaknesses, and
these strengths.

    Over the last few days I have been meeting scientists, mainly specialists
on the brain, as well as psychologists and psychotherapists....  The majority
of them agreed...  that the key cause of the mental unrest and depression so
prevalent today...  is lack of sympathy and affection.
    I think you might find the following story quite interesting.  A few weeks
ago I met someone whose mind, I was told, is severely disturbed.  At the
beginning, I used all of my reasoning to encourage him, explaining that, as a
human being, there was no need for him to be discouraged, because we have such
a good human brain and intelligence.  I pointed out how, with determination,
we can solve all our human problems and overcome all obstacles, and so there
is no reason to worry or be discouraged or depressed.  Personally, I always
find this kind of reasoning is quite effective, but this time it failed.  He
was not impressed by this line of thinking.  On the contrary, instead of
showing any appreciation, he developed a rather contrary attitude.  After
listening to what I had to say, he became even more agitated, and asked me,
"Why are you concerned about my problem?  How do I know if your attitude is
sincere or not?"  I felt really sad.  I was quite moved as well, and as I was
explaining something or other, my hand reached out and caressed his arm.  It
was a natural gesture, a sincere expression of how I felt.  Gradually, his
mood altered; I could see his face beginning to change, and finally a smile
began to appear.  Then as I gained confidence, I increased that expression of
affection.  At last a big smile spread right across his face.
    I told him, "Please consider me as an old friend.  Any time, you can come
to see me.  Whatever I can do to help you, I am ready to do.  I am at your
service."  When I said this, then his mood, it was clear, became very happy
and joyful.  The following day he came to see me again.  When he arrived, he
already had a happy air about him, but nevertheless he was trying to pretend
otherwise and was not smiling.  Anyway, what this incident really gave me was
another confirmation of how powerful genuine compassion, love, or altruism can
be, to affect other people's minds.  And how they can remove fear and
suspicion, and alleviate feelings of insecurity and mistrust.
    So I always consider compassion as the key, not only for achieving and
maintaining our own mental calmness, stability and happiness, but also as
something extraordinarily useful for creating a healthy human society.  By
that I mean a happier and less harmful human society.  Therefore--whether it
be in individual cases, on a family level, a national level, or an
international level--altruism, love and compassion are the basis for success,
for happiness, and for a happy environment.

According to Tibetan Buddhism, ordinary beings are born into life situations
in which they are destined to suffer and die.  This is the result of former
contaminated actions and afflictions, which have been accumulated since
beginningless time.  Because of this process, physical and mental afflictions
are deeply rooted in sentient beings, and so it is generally considered
necessary to prepare oneself for tantric practice by engaging in the
"preliminary practices," or ngondro (sngon 'gro, purvagama), in order to begin
to reverse one's negative conditioning.  These practices combine physical
movements with visualization in order to transform the mind from one that is
fixated on mundane concerns and desires into one that is primarily oriented
toward religious practice for the benefit of others.  Some teachers consider
these preparatory trainings to be so essential to successful tantric practice
that they will not give tantric initiations to those who have not completed
them, and even teachers who are willing to waive them generally stress their
importance.  The preliminary practices are: (1) taking refuge; (2)
prostration; (3) Vajrasattva meditation; (4) mandala offering; and (5) guru
yoga.

    [It] is quite clear to me is that the moment you think only of yourself,
the focus of your whole reality narrows, and because of this narrow focus,
uncomfortable things can appear huge and bring you fear and discomfort and a
sense of feeling overwhelmed by misery.  The moment you think of others with a
sense of caring, however, your view widens.  Within that wider perspective,
your own problems appear to be of little significance, and this makes a big
difference.
    If you have a sense of caring for others, you will manifest a kind of
inner strength in spite of your own difficulties and problems.  With this
strength, your own problems will seem less significant and bothersome to you.
By going beyond your own problems and taking care of others, you gain inner
strength, self-confidence, courage, and a greater sense of calm.  This is a
clear example of how one's way of thinking can really make a difference.
    One's own self-interest and wishes are fulfilled as a byproduct of
actually working for other sentient beings.  As the well-known fifteenth-
century master Tsongkhapa points out in his Great Exposition of the Path to
Enlightenment, "The more the practitioner engages in activities and thoughts
that are focused and directed toward the fulfillment of others' well-being,
the fulfillment or realization of his or her own aspiration will come as a
byproduct without having to make a separate effort."  Some of you may have
actually heard me remark, which I do quite often, that in some sense the
bodhisattvas, the compassionate practitioners of the Buddhist path, are
"wisely selfish" people, whereas people like us are the "foolishly selfish."
We think of ourselves and disregard others, and the result is that we always
remain unhappy and have a miserable time.
    ...we find that kindness and a good heart form the underlying foundation
for our success in this life, our progress on the spiritual path, and our
fulfillment of our ultimate aspiration, the attainment of full enlightenment.
Hence, compassion and a good heart are not only important at the beginning but
also in the middle and at the end.  Their necessity and value are not limited
to any specific time, place, society, or culture.
    Thus, we not only need compassion and human affection to survive, but they
are the ultimate sources of success in life.  Selfish ways of thinking not
only harm others, they prevent the very happiness we ourselves desire.  The
time has come to think more wisely, hasn't it?  This is my belief.

    ...all apparent phenomena are nothing but delusion and there is, moreover,
no freedom from delusion to be achieved by dispelling delusion.  Delusion is,
by its own essence, completely pure and, hence, enlightened.  All phenomena
are, in this way, primordially, fully, and completely enlightened.  Phenomena
appearing as various attributes are, therefore, indeed the mandala of vajra
body, speech, and mind.  They are like the Buddhas of the three times, never
transcending the essence of complete purity.  Sentient beings and Buddhas are
not differentiated in terms of their essence.  Just like distinct causes and
results appearing in a dream, they are nothing but perceptions of individual
minds brought forth by the power of imputation.
    Here the issue might be raised, "although the scriptures do teach this,
there is no certainty whether it is to be taken at face value or requires
interpretation.  Therefore the essential purity of phenomena may well be
established, but it is unreasonable to say that precisely the nature of that
which appears as subjects with attributes is primordially enlightened.  For,
if it were that way, thorough affliction and samsara would be entirely absent.
There can't be a reasoning that establishes such a philosophy."  The
conceptual mind that takes objects that appear in the experience of sentient
beings as valid is, since beginningless time, deluded.  It accepts or negates
with reference to the way things appear to it.  With such dialectics it is,
indeed, not possible to establish the vast and profound meaning.  Nevertheless,
since the nature of phenomena is inconceivable, it is not the case that there
is no way to realize it by means of discriminating knowledge.  Thus it is not
in any way a mistake if one, rather than that, is inclined to approach simply
by faith, regarding the scriptures and oral instructions as valid.  One will
then gain access through trust.
    One may object, "Well, if one cannot prove [the primordial mandala] with
reasoning, one cannot gain access to it either."  We can prove it as follows:
That phenomena are fully enlightened as the mandala of vajra body, speech, and
mind is proven with the reasoning of the intrinsic nature.  Just as it is
stated in a sutra, "Form is empty by nature.  Why is that?  It is so because
that is its nature."  All phenomena are pure by their intrinsic nature and,
therefore, there is not a single phenomenon that is impure.  This is the
intrinsic nature of phenomena.  Complete purity is, therefore, also the
intrinsic nature of body, speech, and mind, and their complete purity is
enlightenment.  Therefore, body, speech, and mind, distinguished by their
complete purity, are inseparable, free from mental constructs, and perfectly
pervasive.  One must in this way understand them to be the mandala of vajra
body, speech, and mind.

    Because spirits can be positive or negative in relation to humans, it is
wise to be careful with practices that connect the practitioner to a spirit.
It is currently popular for people to take drum journeys in their imaginations
and to look for guardian spirits and power animals and so on.  Although
usually this is beneficial, or at least harmless, there really are beings with
whom the rare individual will connect.  Not all of them are beings anyone
should want to connect with.  There seems to be little regard for who the
being is; this can be a dangerous practice.  People are much more careful
about choosing a business partner or a roommate than they seem to be about
choosing a non-physical being for a guide or guardian.

    ...reflect upon the negative consequences of our strong attachment to
friends and hostility toward enemies.  Our feelings for a friend or a loved
one sometimes blind us to certain of his or her aspects.  We project a quality
of absolute desirability, absolute infallibility, upon that person.  Then,
when we see something contrary to our projections, we are stunned.  We swing
from the extreme of love and desire to disappointment, repulsion, and
sometimes even anger.  Even that sense of inner contentment and satisfaction
in a relationship with someone we love can lead to disappointment,
frustration, and hatred.  Though strong emotions, like those of romantic love
or righteous hatred, may feel profoundly compelling, their pleasure is
fleeting.  From a Buddhist point of view, it is far better not to be in the
grip of such emotions in the first place.
    What are the repercussions of becoming overpowered by intense dislike?
The Tibetan word for hatred, shedang, suggests hostility from the depth of
one's heart.  There is a certain irrationality in responding to injustice or
harm with hostility.  Our hatred has no physical effect on our enemies; it
does not harm them.  Rather, it is we who suffer the ill consequences of such
overwhelming bitterness.  It eats us from within.  With anger we slowly begin
to lose our appetite.  We cannot sleep at night and often end up just rolling
back and forth, back and forth, all night long.  It affects us profoundly,
while our enemies continue along, blissfully unaware of the state we have been
reduced to.
    Free of hatred or anger, we can respond to actions committed against us
far more effectively.  If we approach things with a cool head, we see the
problem more clearly and judge the best way to address it.  For example, if a
child is doing something that could be dangerous to himself or others, such as
playing with matches, we can discipline him.  When we behave in such a
forthright manner, there is a far greater chance that our actions will hit the
mark.  The child will respond not to our anger but to our sense of urgency and
concern.
    This is how we come to see that our true enemy is actually within us.  It
is our selfishness, our attachment, and our anger that harm us.  Our perceived
enemy's ability to inflict harm on us is really quite limited.  If someone
challenges us and we can muster the inner discipline to resist retaliating, it
is possible that no matter what the person has done, those actions do not
disturb us.

  "All phenomena should be understood as lacking an end and a middle, just
  as the mind does not have an end or a middle.  With the knowledge that the
  mind is without an end or a middle, no identity of the mind is perceived.
  What is thoroughly realized by the mind, too, is realized as being empty.
  By realizing that, the very identity, which is established as the aspect
  of the mind, like the identity of physical form, and so forth, is also
  ultimately not perceived.  In this way, when the person does not ultimately
  see the identity of all phenomena through wisdom, he will not analyze
  whether physical form is permanent or impermanent, empty or not empty,
  contaminated or not contaminated, produced or non-produced, and existent
  or non-existent.  Just as physical form is not examined, similarly feeling,
  recognition, compositional factors, and consciousness are not examined.
  When the object does not exist, its characteristics also cannot exist.
  So how can they be examined?"
      -- Stages of Meditation by Kamalashila

The above passage deals with ultimate reality; its meaning is that in the
ultimate sense the object of imputation is not findable.  In this context we
find in the Heart Sutra phrases like: "There is no physical form, no sound, no
smell, no taste, and no object of touch."  The mind, too, is not findable in
the ultimate sense.  Since in the ultimate sense such things are non-existent,
there is no point examining whether they are permanent or impermanent.
Ultimately all phenomena, including the aggregates and so forth, are devoid of
true existence.  Within the notion of ultimate reality, things are devoid of
true existence.  In the same way, suchness, which is an attribute of
phenomena, is also devoid of true existence.  This is important.  Even when we
understand that phenomena like physical form and so forth are devoid of true
existence, there is a danger of thinking that ultimate reality may have true
existence.

    We usually discriminate strongly between someone who intends to harm us
and someone who doesn't.  We think, "That's all right; he didn't mean it"; or
the person who has harmed us can say, "Why do you blame me so much?  I didn't
mean to."  But we get really angry when we know people mean to harm us.  How
could we possibly see such people as intimate, close, dear--as dear as our
best of friends?
    If you can retain a little compassion when people harm you
unintentionally, you have made progress.  But if you retain it when someone
intends to harm you, you are really successful.  It's not that you think,
"This person is marvelous; she's trying to rob me," but you don't take these
facts as reasons for hating the person.  You recognize the intention and put
your wallet in your front pocket.  You take such measures, but the conditions
that prompted them no longer serve as reasons for hatred.  Our wish to love
everyone and the actual attitudes we have under pressure are in constant
conflict.  That's just the way we are.  We've been wandering in cyclic
existence since beginningless time, because of desire and hatred, and it's
going to take a lot of familiarization to change this.  Be relaxed about it.
Don't put pressure on yourself, thinking things like, "Oh, I'm a scumbag
because I hate so deeply."  Rather, try this attitude: "I have to admit it.
As much as my ideals say I should love so-and-so--or at least be neutral--I
have to face the fact that I don't."  Go easy on yourself.

    Many types of valid consciousnesses derive from basic, natural, and
obvious perception.  All of us have an innate "I," although if we try to
locate this "I," we get into a lot of difficulties.  This sense of "I" gives
us a well-founded aspiration to happiness and a wish not to suffer.
    There are different levels of happiness and different kinds of suffering.
Material things usually correspond to physical happiness, whereas spiritual
development corresponds to mental happiness.  Since our "I" has these two
aspects--physical and mental--we need an inseparable combination of material
progress and internal, or spiritual, progress.  Balancing these is crucial to
utilizing material progress and inner development for the good of human
society.
    Big schemes for world development arise from this wish to gain happiness
and relieve suffering.  But there are higher levels of happiness beyond these
worldly forms, in which one seeks something longer-term, not just confined to
this lifetime.  Just as we need a long-range perspective that protects the
environment, we need an internal long-range perspective that extends to future
lifetimes.

        Desire is painful because of not getting,
        Anger is painful through lack of might,
        And confusion through not understanding.
        Because of this, these are not recognized.

    Desire produces suffering when one does not encounter what one badly
wants.  Anger produces suffering when one lacks might to crush the strong.
Confusion* induces suffering when one fails to understand a subtle matter
thoroughly.  The inability to recognize these forms of suffering when one is
overwhelmed by desire and so forth is great suffering indeed.  Therefore,
persevere in getting rid of the disturbing emotions.  It is like a poor man's
son who suffered because he wanted a queen.
    A certain poor man wanted a queen, but kings keep their queens heavily
guarded, and because he could not get her, his desire made him suffer.  He
felt anger toward the king for guarding his queens well, and since he could
not do the slightest harm to the king, he suffered acutely on account of his
anger.  Blinded by desire and anger his confusion grew, and unable to
understand the situation properly, he was tormented by the suffering it caused
him.

* confusion's function is to feed desire and anger.

    To consider those things which are existent, there are many phenomena
which are produced only occasionally.  For example, certain plants grow only
during certain seasons, not all the time.  That shows that they have been
produced by their causes and conditions.  On the other hand, certain phenomena
exist permanently.  Those are the two types of phenomena.  In the case of
phenomena which arise only occasionally for a certain period of time then
cease to exist, their production is evidence used to prove their dependence on
their causes and conditions.  But permanent phenomena are not dependent on
causes and conditions.  Generally speaking, almost all phenomena which are
beneficial or harmful to us belong to the category of the occasional, the
dependent--the impermanent.  Even our mind, which is to be disciplined and
subdued, belongs to that category.
    Within the kind of phenomena which are existent, we can talk about
different types: those which are animate and those which are inanimate; those
with form and those formless; visible and invisible; audible and inaudible.
And there are phenomena which definitely exist but can be experienced only by
our mind, not our sense perceptions; in other words, we can talk about two
types of phenomena, external matter and internal consciousness.  When we talk
about subduing mind, we refer to internal consciousness, that which has
clarity and cognitive power and is capable of experiencing objects.  Although
our mind has arisen depending upon its causes and conditions, we need to find
out to what extent it can be transformed, for it is through the transformation
of our mind that we can subdue it.  The way of transformation is to pacify the
mind's faults and to cultivate and enhance its good qualities.  Although there
are certain phenomena which, having arisen from their causes and conditions,
remain as they are and cannot be changed by any means, there are others,
including our mind, which can be.  To establish that kind of distinction, the
reasons provided in the Lam-rim section on analytical meditation to generate
special insight are especially important and useful.

Whatever appears, nothing has moved from the absolute nature.

Decide that nothing is extraneous to the absolute nature, taking the
example of gold jewelry.
    Once we know how to remain in the absolute nature, the manifold thoughts
that arise in the mind are no different from gold jewelry.  One can make all
sorts of things out of gold, such as earrings, bracelets, and necklaces, but
although they have a variety of different shapes, they are all made of gold.
Likewise, if we are able to not move from the absolute nature, however many
thoughts we might have, they never depart from the recognition of the absolute
nature.  A yogi for whom this is the case never departs from that realization,
whatever he does with his body, speech, and mind.  All his actions arise as
the outer display or ornament of wisdom.  All the signs one would expect from
meditating on a deity come spontaneously without him actually doing any formal
practice.  The result of mantra recitation is obtained without his having to
do a large number of recitations.  In this way everything is included in the
recognition that nothing is ever extraneous to the absolute nature.
    In that state one does not become excited at pleasant events or depressed
by unpleasant ones.

It makes no sense to brood anxiously on the harmful actions we have committed
in the past to the point where we become paralyzed.  They are done, it is
over.  If the person is a believer in God, the appropriate action is to find
some means of reconciliation with Him.  So far as Buddhist practice is
concerned, there are various rites and practices for purification.  When the
individual has no religious beliefs, however, it is surely a matter of
acknowledging and accepting any negative feelings we may have in relation to
our misdeeds and developing a sense of sorrow and regret for them.  But then,
rather than stopping at mere sorrow and regret, it is important to use this as
the basis for resolve, for a deep-seated commitment never again to harm others
and to direct our actions all the more determinedly to the benefit of others.
The act of disclosure, or confession, of our negative actions to another--
especially to someone we really respect and trust--will be found to be very
helpful in this.  We are quite wrong if we merely acknowledge the gravity of
our actions inwardly and then, instead of confronting our feelings, give up
all hope and do nothing.  This only compounds the error.  Above all, we should
remember that as long as we retain the capacity of concern for others, the
potential for transformation remains.
  -- His Holiness the Dalai Lama, "Ethics for the New Millennium"
~
    According to Buddhism, compassion is an aspiration, a state of mind,
wanting others to be free from suffering.  It's not passive--it's not empathy
alone--but rather an empathetic altruism that actively strives to free others
from suffering.  Genuine compassion must have both wisdom and lovingkindness.
That is to say, one must understand the nature of the suffering from which we
wish to free others (this is wisdom), and one must experience deep intimacy
and empathy with other sentient beings (this is lovingkindness).  Let's
examine these two elements.
    The suffering from which we wish to liberate other sentient beings,
according to Buddha's teachings, has three levels.  The first level includes
the obvious physical and mental sensations of pain and discomfort that we can
all easily identify as suffering.  This kind of suffering is primarily at the
sensory level--unpleasant or painful sensations and feelings.  The great
Tibetan master Panchen Losang Chokyi Gyaltsan, tutor to the fifth Dalai Lama,
reminds us that even animals seek to avoid physical suffering and pain.
    The second level of suffering is the suffering of change.  Although
certain experiences or sensations may seem pleasurable and desirable now,
inherent within them is the potential for culminating in an unsatisfactory
experience.  Another way of saying this is that experiences do not last
forever; desirable experiences will eventually be replaced by a neutral
experience or an undesirable experience.  If it were not the case that
desirable experiences are of the nature of change, then, once having a happy
experience, we would remain happy forever!  In fact, if desirability were
intrinsic to an experience, then the longer we remained in contact with it,
the happier we would become.  However, this is not the case.  In fact, often,
the more we pursue these experiences, the greater our level of
disillusionment, dissatisfaction, and unhappiness becomes.
    ...But the third level of suffering is the most significant--the pervasive
suffering of conditioning.  This refers to the very fact of our unenlightened
existence, the fact that we are ruled by negative emotions and their
underlying root cause, namely our own fundamental ignorance of the nature of
reality.  Buddhism asserts that as long as we are under the control of this
fundamental ignorance, we are suffering; this unenlightened existence is
suffering by its very nature.
    If we are to cultivate the deepest wisdom, we must understand suffering at
its deepest, most pervasive level.  In turn, freedom from that level of
suffering is true nirvana, true liberation, the true state of cessation.
Freedom from the first level of suffering alone--merely being free of
unpleasant physical and psychological experiences--is not true cessation of
suffering.  Freedom from the second level is again not true cessation.
However, freedom from the third level of suffering--being completely free from
the very source of suffering--that is genuine cessation, genuine liberation.

     of Wisdom Teachings", translated & edited by Geshe Thupten Jinpa

    The only conclusion that can legitimately be reached is that the self is a
fiction, a mere label superimposed onto the aggregates, a concept created and
reified by the mind but lacking any substantial reality.  This reasoning
process alone does not eliminate the idea, however; it merely weakens it.
Because it is so deeply ingrained, the idea of self is only eliminated through
repeated meditation on the reasonings of no-self, which enable the yogin to
become progressively more familiar with the understanding that no self or
essence exists.  The Dalai Lama concludes that "when such a realization is
maintained and reinforced through constant meditation and familiarization, you
will be able to develop it into an intuitive or direct experience." (From Path
to Bliss.)
    Many Westerners reject this notion, contending that it would be a sort of
cognitive suicide.  The idea that the self (which is assumed even by people
who reject religions that propound the idea) does not exist is profoundly
disturbing to many non-Buddhists, but in Buddhist thought the denial of self
is not seen as constituting a loss, but rather is viewed as a profoundly
liberating insight.  Since the innate idea of self implies an autonomous,
unchanging essence, if such a thing were in fact the core of one's being, it
would mean that change would be impossible, and one would be stuck being just
what one is right now.  Because there is no such self, however, we are open
toward the future.  One's nature is never fixed and determined, and so through
engaging in Buddhist practice one can exert control over the process of change
and progress in wisdom, compassion, patience, and other good qualities.  One
can even become a buddha, a fully awakened being who is completely liberated
from all the frailties, sufferings, and limitations of ordinary beings.  But
this is only possible because there is no permanent and static self, no soul
that exists self-sufficiently, separated from the ongoing process of change.

    I often encounter people in and our of my office who seem to be lost in
thought.  I sometimes ask them what they are thinking about.  They are usually
startled by the question.  They look at me blankly and are often surprised to
hear themselves admit with embarrassment that they don't know or can't say.
Or they describe one small, fleeting fragment of disconnected thought.  The
"normal" human state of mind is constant, incessant thinking--an enigmatically
linked stream of consciousness, sensations, memories, feelings, desires,
fears, and chatter.  And at the center of the narrative, the star of the show
is always--ME!  This is why the first leg of the journey requires courage.  To
become familiar with the chaotic, egotistical, and often nonsensical narrative
of our own mind stream is disconcerting and painful.  To discover directly
that we are literally "lost in thought" can be frightening.  But this is where
we are and where we must begin.
    It's consoling to remember that everyone is neurotic, each one of us.  The
"normal" mind suffers from a complex of conflicting desires and aversions.
The best we can do is to become aware of our neuroses, to become wiser in our
thinking and our conduct of life.  In my experience, meditation is the most
direct and efficient method for developing self-awareness.  Self-awareness is
not a steady state because experience is not a steady state.  Through the
practice of meditation, we can learn to watch our ever-fluctuating mental
processes from a more detached, aerial perspective.  Without necessarily
understanding ourselves in some intellectual way, we can directly discover how
the mind works.  The mind has its causes and effects, its motivations and
intentions, and its awareness and evaluation of their possible consequences.

    In Chapter 4 we looked at the when and where of meditation.  Whatever
works best for you, given your personal circumstances and temperament, the
important thing is to do it regularly, preferably every day.
    I would also recommend that you keep the session to a length of time that
feels comfortable.  This is because in the early stages of meditation it's
easy to become discouraged and have thoughts along the lines of: "This might
work for other people, but I don't have the right personality/mind/lifestyle/
partner for meditation." Or: "I've been doing this for six months and my
concentration is no better than when I started." With thoughts like these, you
may start to resent the time you spend meditating and consider giving up.
    Much better to keep your practice light and easy to begin with; short
sessions, and concentrated attention, especially towards the end of your
practice so that you "finish like a winner" and feel encouraged for the next
day.  Better to end a short session thinking you could have gone on longer
than keep glancing at your watch with the thought that has passed through the
mind of every meditator at some stage--"My watch must have stopped.  It's been
longer than two minutes--surely?!"
    Having reviewed the meditation practices outlined in the previous chapter,
you may decide you quite like the sound of several of them.  On what basis
should they be practiced?  My own preference is to have a simple calendar of
activity so that, for example, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays are breath-
counting days; Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays are visualization days; and
Sundays are for whatever I'm in the mood to do.
    On this point, I once asked a high-ranking Tibetan lama which of a number
of meditation practices I should focus on.  He gave me an indulgent smile and
said simply, "Whichever you enjoy the most." D'oh!

"Always be sustained by cheerfulness."

    The effectiveness of our practice can be measured by looking at our mood.
If we are in better spirits, the practice is working.  We can take heart
because we have a purpose, to exchange whatever sadness we meet for joy.  The
smallest personal damage can be put to use to dissolve great suffering and do
away with negativity.  If there is a way, we try to stop unfortunate things
from happening, but when unhappy events occur we meet them optimistically.  We
never let negativity discourage us or injure our ability to help.
    Setting out on any adventure demands determination.  We may have to toil
and struggle with setbacks along the way but the trials we face are short-
lived.  We can endure them because we have a great end in mind: to benefit all
sentient beings.  Remaining good-natured and enthusiastic shows that our
efforts are succeeding.  Being cheerful is the sign of a good practitioner.

    Once we take ourselves and the quality of our life seriously, and
acknowledge the difficulties we may be experiencing, the next step is to have
confidence that (1) it is possible to overcome them, (2) there is a way to
accomplish this, and (3) we are capable of achieving it [Buddha-nature].  This
bring us to the topics of refuge and Buddha-nature.
    Taking refuge is not a passive act of placing ourselves in the hands of a
higher power that will do everything for us, as the English word "refuge"
might imply.  It is an active process of putting a safe, reliable and positive
direction in our life.  That direction is indicated by the Buddhas, the Dharma
and the Sangha--the Three Precious Gems.  They are precious in the sense that
they are both rare and valuable....
    In short, the definitive level of the Three Precious Gems of Buddha,
Dharma and Sangha presents the goal we would like to achieve.  Their
interpretable level indicates what we rely on, externally, to bring ourselves
there.  But we also have internal factors that we need to rely on as well.
These refer to our Buddha-nature.
    We are capable of eliminating our problems and achieving the definitive
Three Precious Gems because everyone has Buddha-nature, namely the various
factors or working materials that make it possible.  Of all our natural
resources, the most important is mind.  We all have a mind which, in its
nature, is unhampered by anything from experiencing whatever exists.  No
matter what happens--no matter how confused, stressed or unhappy we may be--we
experience it.  Even death is something that we experience when it occurs.
Therefore, because we have a mind that allows us to experience whatever
exists, we have the basic resource that allows us to experience a total
absence of confusion and a utilization of all possible good qualities for
helping others--provided that such a total absence and utilization actually
exist.  In other words, if we can establish that it is possible for these two
things to exist--and that they are not just objects of nice but totally
unrealistic wishes--we can be confident that we are capable of attaining them,
simply because we have a mind.

    Actually, we Buddhists are supposed to save all sentient beings, but
practically speaking, this may be too broad a notion for most people.  In any
case, we must at least think in terms of helping all human beings.  This is
very important.  Even if we cannot think in terms of sentient beings
inhabiting different worlds, we should nonetheless think in terms of the human
beings on our own planet.  To do this is to take a practical approach to the
problem.  It is necessary to help others, not only in our prayers, but in our
daily lives.  If we find we cannot help another, the least we can do is to
desist from harming them.  We must not cheat others or lie to them.  We must
be honest human beings, sincere human beings.
    On a very practical level, such attitudes are things which we need.
Whether one is a believer, a religious person, or not, is another matter.
Simply as an inhabitant of the world, as a member of the human family, we need
this kind of attitude.  It is through such an attitude that real and lasting
world peace and harmony can be achieved.  Through harmony, friendship, and
respecting one another, we can solve many problems in the right way, without
difficulties.

...Maitreya, in his text the Sublime Continuum, gives three reasons on the
basis of which one can conclude that the essence of Buddhahood permeates the
minds of all sentient beings.  First, he says that the Buddha's activities
radiate in the heart of all sentient beings.  Now this can be understood in
two different ways: one is that we can understand that in every sentient being
there is a seed of virtue, and one could see the seed of virtue as an act of
the completely enlightened, compassionate Buddha.  But one could also see it
in deeper terms, that is, that all sentient beings possess the potential for
perfection.  Therefore, there is a kind of perfected being inherent within all
sentient beings, radiating.  So one can understand it in these ways.  Second,
so far as the ultimate nature of reality is concerned, there is total equality
between the samsaric state and nirvana.  Third, we all possess a mind which
lacks intrinsic reality and independent existence, which allows us to then
remove the negativities and delusory states that obscure it.  For these three
reasons, Maitreya concludes that all sentient beings possess the essence of
Buddhahood.

    ...Compassion diminishes fright about your own pain and increases inner
strength.  It gives you a sense of empowerment, of being able to accomplish
your tasks.  It lends encouragement.
    Let me give you a small example.  Recently, when I was in Bodh Gaya, I
fell ill from a chronic intestinal infection.  On the way to the hospital, the
pain in my abdomen was severe, and I was sweating a great deal.  The car was
passing through the area of Vulture Peak (Buddha taught here) where the
villagers are extremely poor.  In general, Bihar State is poor, but that
particular area is even more so.  I did not even see children going to or
coming from school.  Just poverty.  And sickness.  I have a very clear memory
of a small boy with polio, who had rusty metal braces on his legs and metal
crutches up to his armpits.  It was obvious that he had no one to look after
him.  I was very moved.  A little later on, there was an old man at a tea
stop, wearing only a dirty piece of cloth, fallen to the ground, left to lie
there with no one to take care of him.
    Later, at the hospital, my thoughts kept circling on what I had seen,
reflecting on how sad it was that here I had people to take care of me but
those poor people had no one.  That is where my thoughts went, rather than to
my own suffering.  Though sweat was pouring out of my body, my concern was
elsewhere.
    In this way, though my body underwent a lot of pain that prevented sleep
(a hole had opened in my intestinal wall), my mind did not suffer any fear or
discomfort.  It would only have made the situation worse if I had concentrated
on my own problems.  This is an example from my small experience of how an
attitude of compassion helps even oneself, suppressing some degree of physical
pain and keeping away mental distress, despite the fact that others might not
be directly helped.
    Compassion strengthens your outlook, and with that courage you are more
relaxed.  When your perspective includes the suffering of limitless beings,
your own suffering looks comparatively small.

    ...blissful light, with a Chenrezig on the tip of each ray, streams out of
you and touches each and every sentient being--those whom you like, those whom
you don't, and those you don't know.  When this glowing light touches each
sentient being, it performs two functions: it purifies them of their
negativities, and it inspires them to realize all the stages of the path to
enlightenment.  We may start imagining the light touching the beings in the
room and gradually spreading out to those in the area, the country, the
continent, the world, and the universe.  Or we can start with our friends and
family, then radiate light to strangers, and finally to those who have harmed
us or of whom we're afraid.  Or, we can first radiate light to human beings,
then animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, demi-gods, and gods.  We can use our
creativity and imagination when doing this visualization.  Each meditation
session can have a different emphasis.
    It's very easy to love sentient beings in a general way.  But it's more
effective to be specific in our visualizations.  Send light to the guy who cut
you off on the highway.  Send light to the IRS employee who questioned your
tax return.  Send light to the terrorist who thinks that killing others in the
name of God will cause him to be reborn in heaven.  Send light to government
leaders who think that bombing others solves problems.  Send light to your
teenager who leaves his room a mess and gets mad when you comment on it.  Send
light to specific people you know and care about, people who are having
problems, strangers, and people you don't like.  Send it to hospitals, the
Middle East, the inner cities, and Beverly Hills.  There's suffering
everywhere.  The light frees sentient beings from their suffering.

    In Tibetan drenpa means "mindfulness," and sheshin means "awareness."
Drenpa also means "mindfulness and memory." It means that one is mindful of
what one is doing and remembers what one has to do whether one is meditating,
whether one has lost the power of concentration, and so on.  Mindfulness is
like a causal condition and awareness is like the result.  If one has very
concentrated mindfulness, one immediately notices a thought arising and this
becomes awareness, which becomes sheshin, and one knows what is occurring.
Normally, one does not know what is in one's mind or what one is thinking, so
there is no awareness.  But if one has mindfulness, then it is said to the
extent that mindfulness brings mental stability, one has awareness.  So when
one has mindfulness, it is through one's awareness of what is happening.
    At this level of pacification we become aware of the negative qualities of
distraction.  Santideva explains this by saying that when the mind is
distracted, it is between the fangs of the wild animal of the kleshas
[emotional obscurations], and from mental distractions come all the
difficulties and mental hardships of this and future lives.  Being in a state
of distraction will increase the negative qualities of the mind more and more.
However, being aware of the negative qualities motivates us to meditate.

    Developing a flexible approach to living is not only instrumental in
helping us cope with everyday problems--it also becomes the cornerstone for a
key element of a happy life: balance.
    Settling comfortably into his chair one morning, the Dalai Lama explained
the value of leading a balanced life.
        "A balanced and skillful approach to life, taking care to avoid
extremes, becomes a very important factor in conducting one's everyday
existence.  It is important in all aspects of life.  For instance, in planting
a sapling of a plant or a tree, at its very early stage you have to be very
skillful and gentle.  Too much moisture will destroy it, too much sunlight
will destroy it.  Too little will also destroy it.  So what you need is a very
balanced environment where the sapling can have a healthy growth.  Or, for a
person's physical health, too much or too little of any one thing can have
destructive effects.  For example, too much protein I think is bad, and too
little is bad.
        "This gentle and skillful approach, taking care to avoid extremes,
applies to healthy mental and emotional growth as well."

     Happiness: A Handbook for Living"

    ...Idle talk is usually considered a destructive action because it wastes
our time.  But if our friend is depressed and can't listen to wise advice, we
can joke, tell silly stories, and use small talk to lighten his mood.  Because
our motivation is kind, our joking and chatting are positive.
    Laughing and having a good time aren't in opposition to Dharma.  The more
we leave behind attachment, anger, jealousy, and pride, the more we'll enjoy
whatever we're doing.  Our hearts will open to others and we can laugh and
smile with ease.  The holy beings I've been fortunate to meet have a wonderful
sense of humor and are very friendly.
    In Buddhist groups, it's important for people to get to know each other
and have a sense of fellowship.  We can share experiences with our Dharma
friends and encourage each other on the path.  Buddhism isn't an isolated
path, and it's important for Buddhists to cultivate group unity and
companionship.
    It's not beneficial to retreat inside ourselves, thinking, "Every time I
talk to someone I'm motivated by attachment.  Therefore I'll concentrate on
meditation and chanting and won't socialize with others." One of the
fundamental principles of Buddhism is care and compassion for others.
Although at times we may need to distance ourselves from others in order to
settle our own minds, whenever possible we should actively develop genuine
love for others.  To do this, we must be aware of what's happening in others'
lives, care about them as we do ourselves, and offer help whenever possible.
Our ability to act with love develops with time and practice, and it has to be
balanced with our need for private contemplation.

Young men and young women may work systematically six days in the week and
rise fresh in the morning, but let them attend modern dances for only a few
hours each evening and see what happens.  The Waltz, Polka, Gallop and other
dances of the same kind will be disastrous in their effects to both sexes.
Health and vigor will vanish like the dew before the sun.  It is not the
extraordinary exercise which harms the dancer, but rather the coming into
close contact with the opposite sex.  It is the fury of lust craving
incessantly for more pleasure that undermines the soul, the body, the sinews
and nerves.  Experience and statistics show beyond doubt that passionate
excessive dancing girls can hardly reach twenty-five years of age and men
thirty-one.  Even if they reached that age they will in most instances be
broken in health physically and morally.  This is the claim of prominent
physicians in this country.

    I remember most vividly my first lesson on epistemology as a child, when I
had to memorize the dictum "The definition of the mental is that which is
luminous and knowing." Drawing on earlier Indian sources, Tibetan thinkers
defined consciousness.  It was years later that I realized just how
complicated is the philosophical problem hidden behind this simple
formulation.  Today when I see nine-year-old monks confidently citing this
definition of consciousness on the debating floor, which is such a central
part of Tibetan monastic education, I smile.
    These two features--luminosity, or clarity, and knowing, or cognizance--
have come to characterize "the mental" in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist thought.
Clarity here refers to the ability of mental states to reveal or reflect.
Knowing, by contrast, refers to mental states' faculty to perceive or
apprehend what appears.  All phenomena possessed of these qualities count as
mental.  These features are difficult to conceptualize, but then we are
dealing with phenomena that are subjective and internal rather than material
objects that may be measured in spatiotemporal terms.  Perhaps it is because
of these difficulties--the limits of language in dealing with the subjective--
that many of the early Buddhist texts explain the nature of consciousness in
terms of metaphors such as light, or a flowing river.  As the primary feature
of light is to illuminate, so consciousness is said to illuminate its objects.
Just as in light there is no categorical distinction between the illumination
and that which illuminates, so in consciousness there is no real difference
between the process of knowing or cognition and that which knows or cognizes.
In consciousness, as in light, there is a quality of illumination.

     of Science and Spirituality"

    False conceptions are exaggerated modes of thought that do not accord with
the facts.  Even if an object--an event, a person, or any other phenomenon--
has a slightly favorable aspect, once the object is mistakenly seen as
existing totally from its own side, true and real, mental projection
exaggerates its goodness beyond what it actually is, resulting in lust.  The
same happens with anger and hatred; this time a negative factor is
exaggerated, making the object seem to be a hundred percent negative, the
result being deep disturbance.  Recently, a psychotherapist told me that when
we generate anger, ninety percent of the ugliness of the object of our anger
is due to our own exaggeration.  This is very much in conformity with the
Buddhist idea of how afflictive emotions arise.
    At the point when anger and lust are generated, reality is not seen;
rather, an unreal mental projection of extreme badness or extreme goodness is
seen, evoking twisted, unrealistic actions.  All of this can be avoided by
seeing the fuller picture revealed by paying attention to the dependent-
arising of phenomena, the nexus of causes and conditions from which they arise
and in which they exist.
    Looked at this way, the disadvantages of afflictive emotions are obvious.
If you want to be able to perceive the actual situation, you have to quit
voluntarily submitting to afflictive emotions, because in each and every
field, they obstruct perception of the facts.....
    Love and compassion also involve strong feelings that can even make you
cry with empathy, but they are induced not by exaggeration but by valid
cognition of the plight of sentient beings, and the appropriateness of being
concerned for their well-being.  These feelings rely on insight into how
beings suffer in the round of rebirth called "cyclic existence," and the depth
of these feelings is enhanced through insight into impermanence and
emptiness....  Though it is possible for love and compassion to be influenced
by afflictive emotions, true love and compassion are unbiased and devoid of
exaggeration, because they are founded on valid cognition of your relationship
to others.  The perspective of dependent-arising is supremely helpful in
making sure that you appreciate the wider picture.

The Prajna Paramita is a very profound philosophical doctrine, and I will just
outline the main ideas in it in order to clarify the Chod.  First we start off
with the confused egocentric state of mind.  This state of mind causes us to
suffer, and so, to alleviate the suffering, we start to practice meditation.
What happens in meditation is that the speedy mind begins to slow down and
things begin to settle, like the mud sinking to the bottom of a puddle of
water when it is left undisturbed.  When this settling has occurred, a kind of
clear understanding of the way things work in the mind takes place.  This
understanding is prajna, profound cognition.  Then, according to Buddhist
doctrine, through the use of this prajna, we begin to see that, in fact,
although we think that we have a separate and unique essence, or self, which
we call the "ego," when we look closely, we are a composite of form, sense-
perceptions, consciousness, etc., and are merely a sum of these parts.  This
realization is the understanding of sunyata, usually translated as emptiness,
or voidness.  It means there is no self-essence, that we are "void of a self."
If we are void of a self, there is no reason to be egocentric, since the whole
notion of a separate ego is false.  Therefore we can afford to be
compassionate, and need not continually defend ourselves or force our desires
onto others.

    There is a film called "Groundhog Day," which is really a Buddhist movie
because this is exactly what the plot is about.  For those of you who haven't
seen it, it's about somebody who had to relive the same day again and again
until he got it right.  He started out with an extremely negative attitude,
and so throughout the first day he created a lot of negative causes.  People
related back to him from his own level of negativity, and so he had a very bad
day.  Then the next day he had to experience the same day all over again.
Then again, and again.  He became desperate to find a way out.  He attempted
suicide many times, but the next morning, there he was again in the same room
and the same bed.  The date hadn't changed, and the same song was playing on
the radio.  His attitude underwent many, many changes, until in the end he
spent most of his time trying to help people.  He forestalled tragedies he
knew were going to happen because he had lived the day over so many times, and
his whole attitude gradually turned around into working out ways to help
others.  As his inner attitude transformed, the day gradually got better and
better.  Finally, he was able to break through to a new day.
    The important thing is how we respond to our situation.  We can transform
anything if we respond in a skillful way.  This is precisely what karma is
about.  If we greet situations with a positive attitude, we will eventually
create positive returns.  If we respond with a negative attitude, negative
things will eventually come our way.  Unlike the scenario in the movie, it
doesn't always happen right away.  We can be very nice people but still have
lots of problems.  On the other hand, we can be awful people and have a
wonderful time.  But from a Buddhist perspective, it's just a matter of time
before we receive the results of our conduct.  And usually it is true that
people with a positive attitude encounter positive circumstances.  Even if the
circumstances do not appear positive, they be transformed through a positive
view.  On the other hand people with negative minds complain even when things
are going well.  They also transform circumstances, but they transform
positive ones into negative ones!
    Both our present and our future depend on us.  From moment to moment, we
are creating our future.  We are not a ball of dust tossed about by the winds
of fate.  We have full responsibility for our lives.  The more aware we
become, the more capable we are of making skillful choices.

    Why is endeavor necessary?  If we consider material progress, we see that
research started by one person can always be continued by another.  But this
is not possible with spiritual progress.  The realization we talk about in the
Buddhadharma is something that has to be accomplished by the individual.  No
one else can do it for us.  Of course, it would be wonderful if in the future
we could attain realization through some sort of new injection or by means of
a new generation of computers, without having to go through any difficulties.
If we could be absolutely certain that such a time would come, we could simply
lie back and wait to get enlightened.  But I doubt that this will ever happen.
It is better to make an effort.  We have to develop endeavor.
        I.
        Thus with patience I will practice diligence,
        For it is through zeal that I will reach enlightenment.
        If there is no wind, then nothing stirs;
        Neither is there merit where there is no diligence.
    We can be patient in various ways, such as by not thinking ill of those
who harm us or by accepting suffering as the path.  Of these two, the latter
is the more important for generating endeavor, and it is endeavor that enables
us to attain enlightenment.  As Shantideva says, "It is through zeal that I
will reach enlightenment." In the same way that protecting a lamp from the
wind allows the flame to burn without flickering, endeavor enables the
virtuous mind to grow undisturbed.
    What is endeavor?  It is finding joy in doing what is good.  To do that,
it is necessary to remove anything that counteracts it, especially laziness.
Laziness has three aspects: having no wish to do good, being distracted by
negative activities, and underestimating oneself by doubting one's ability.
Related to these are taking undue pleasure in idleness and sleep and being
indifferent to samsara as a state of suffering.

    Western women emerging from crisis situations often choose to live alone,
intuitively knowing that the confrontation with oneself that this brings will
lead to a deeper understanding.  These women in our society (which sees them
as pitiable and unfortunate) can take strength from the stories of Tibetan
yoginis.
    These Western women also seek the support of other women or
psychotherapists to help them to emerge from their descents, just as the
yoginis sought the guidance of their teachers and spiritual friends, and the
Greeks needed the help of the "therapeutes" [helpers] to make sense of the
memories they brought back from the oracle cave.
    Speaking of the descent myth in terms of her experiences in controlled
therapeutic regressions, Jungian analyst M.L. Von Franz describes the descent
process in relation to the story of "The Handless Maiden":
        In the Middle Ages there were many hermits, and in Switzerland there
        were the so-called Wood Brothers and Sisters.  People who did not want
        to live a monastic life but who wanted to live alone in the forest had
        both a closeness to nature and also a great experience of spiritual
        inner life.  Such Wood Brothers and Sisters could be personalities on
        a high level who had a spiritual fate and had to renounce active life
        for a time and isolate themselves to find their own inner relation to
        God.  It is not very different from what the shaman does in the Polar
        tribes, or what medicine men do all over the world, in order to seek
        an immediate personal religious experience in isolation.
    ...If we avoid the descent because of fear of what we will discover about
ourselves in the "underworld," we block ourselves off from a powerful
transformative process.  This process has been recognized by modern
psychologists and ancient mystery religions alike.

    The modes of thought in pride and in courageous thought are entirely
different.
    Depression caused by disintegration of the ego probably comes from not
being able to posit a conventionally existent I.  Still, when some
understanding of emptiness develops, you have a different feeling of I than
that to which you previously were accustomed.  Our usual feeling is that the I
is something solid, really independent, and very forceful.  Such no longer
remains, but at the same time there is a sense of a mere I that accumulates
karma and performs actions.  Such a sense of self is not at all a source of
depression.
    If you have difficulty positing a merely nominal I as well as merely
nominal cause and effect of actions--if you get to the point where if you
assert selflessness, you cannot posit dependent-arising--then it would be
better to assert dependent-arising and give up selflessness.  Indeed, there
are many levels of understanding selflessness, and Buddha, out of great
skillfulness in method, taught many different schools of tenets that posit
coarser levels of selflessness for those temporarily unable to understand the
more subtle levels.  It is not the case that only if the most profound level
is immediately accessible, it is suitable, and if it is not accessible, the
whole endeavor should be thrown away.  You have to proceed step by step with
whatever accords with your level of mind.  Between emptiness and dependent-
arising, you should value dependent-arising more highly.

[do you have any thoughts about how a person could go about increasing their
feeling of autonomy or freedom at work?]

    ...it will completely depend on the person's individual circumstances,
what position they are in.  Let's take the example of a prisoner.  Now of
course it is best not to be in prison, but even in that situation, where a
person may be deprived of freedom, he or she may discover small choices that
they are able to make.  And even if somebody is in prison, with very rigid
rules, they can undertake some spiritual practices to try to lessen their
mental frustrations, try to get some peace of mind.  So they can work on
internal development...if people can do this under the extreme conditions of
prison, in the workplace people may try to discover small things, small
choices that they can make in how to go about their work.  And of course,
somebody may work on an assembly line with little variation in how to do their
tasks, but they still have other kinds of choices in terms of their attitudes,
how they interact with their co-workers, whether they utilize certain inner
qualities or spiritual strengths to change their attitude at work even though
the nature of the work may be difficult.  Isn't it?  So, perhaps that would
help.
    Of course, when you are talking about rigid rules and lack of freedom,
that doesn't mean that you are required to blindly follow and accept
everything others tell you.  In instances where the worker might be exploited,
where the employer thinks of nothing but profit and pays a small salary and
demands a lot of overtime, or where one may be asked to do things that are not
appropriate or are unethical, one should not simply think, "Well, this is my
karma," and take no action.  Here it is not enough to think, "I should just be
content."
    If there is injustice, then I think inaction is the wrong response.  The
Buddhist texts mention what is called "misplaced tolerance," or "misplaced
forbearance." So...misplaced patience or forbearance refers to the sense of
endurance that some individuals have when they are subject to a very
destructive, negative activity.  That is a misplaced forbearance and
endurance.  Similarly, in the work environment, if there is a lot of injustice
and exploitation, then to passively tolerate it is the wrong response.  The
appropriate response really is to actively resist it, to try to change this
environment rather than accept it.  One should take some action...perhaps one
could speak with the boss, with the management, and try to change these
things.  One needs to actively resist exploitation.  And in some cases, one
may simply need to quit and to look for other work.

    The purpose of Buddha's coming to the world was for the sake of sentient
beings' attaining the wisdom that he achieved.  The paths that he taught are
only a means leading to Buddhahood; he does not lead sentient beings with a
low vehicle that is not a method leading to Buddhahood.  He establishes
sentient beings in the powers and so forth that exist in his own state.

       "Manjushri, all the doctrines that I teach to sentient beings are for
        the sake of attaining omniscient wisdom.  Flowing into enlightenment
        and descending into the Mahayana, they are means of achieving

    We are aiming to develop a strong feeling of love and compassion with
respect to everyone, but this cannot be done without first seeing an equality
of all beings throught meditatively cultivating equanimity.  Otherwise, you'll
easily be able to generate love and compassion for friends and may be able to
extend a little of this to neutral people, but even minor enemies will remain
a huge problem.  Thus at first it is necessary to recognize how friends,
neutral persons, and enemies are equal.
    This is done in two ways.  One way to break down rigid classifications of
people is by reflecting first with respect to friends, then neutral persons,
and then enemies:
       "Just as I want happiness and don't want suffering, so this friend
        wants happiness and doesn't want suffering.  And equally, this neutral
        person wants happiness and doesn't want suffering.  And equally, this
        enemy wants happiness and doesn't want suffering."
    Another way is to reflect on what your relationships have been with others
over the course of lifetimes, beginning with neutral persons, then friends,
and finally enemies.  An enemy in this lifetime wants to do you in, but over
the course of lifetimes was this person just an enemy?  No.  If you do not
believe in rebirth, utilize the rebirth game, the rebirth perspective, as a
technique for making your mind more flexible.
    Either of these techniques will work:
        - Reflecting on the similarity of yourself and others in the basic
          aspiration to gain happiness and be rid of suffering.

        - Reflecting on the changeability of relationships over the course
          of lifetimes.

    What is wisdom?  It is as explained in the perfection of supreme knowledge
teachings: all phenomena are free from elaborations, and when the perceiving
subject as well becomes equally free from elaborations, that is wisdom.  In
particular, the wisdom of the buddha consists in the pacification of the
elaborations and their habitual tendencies in relation to suchness.  It is the
inseparability of the expanse and wisdom.  It is free from singularity and
multiplicity, quality and qualified.  It realizes the nonduality of subjects
and objects.  In it all phenomena--samsara and nirvana, faults and qualities,
and so on--are always undifferentiable and equal.  Outside of that, there is
no way to posit wisdom.
    In a nonanalytical context of repeating what others accept, we Followers
of the Middle Way describe knowable objects as existing.  The wisdom of the
buddhas is the same.  Since we speak of all phenomena as existing from the
perspective of others (even though from our own perspective they are free of
the elaborations of existence and nonexistence), it is unreasonable to debate
solely about the existence or nonexistence of the wisdom of buddhas.

    When this world initially formed, there seem to have been two types of
events or entities, one sentient, the other insentient.  Rocks, for instance,
are examples of nonsentient entities.  You see, we usually consider them to
have no feelings: no pains and no pleasures.  The other type, sentient beings,
have awareness, consciousness, pains and pleasures.
    But there needs to be a cause for that.  If you posit there is no cause
for consciousness, then this leads to all sorts of inconsistencies and logical
problems.  So, the cause is posited, established.  It is considered certain.
    The initial cause must be an independent consciousness.  And on that basis
is asserted the theory of continuation of life after death.  It is during the
interval when one's continuum of awareness departs from one's body at death
that the subtle mind, the subtle consciousness, becomes manifest.  That
continuum connects one life with the next.

    Channels and cakras represent the inner structure of the human body,
referred to in the tantric teachings as the 'vajra body'.  'Vajra' means
'indestructible', and 'vajra body' refers to the dimension of the three
fundamental components: the channels and cakras, the prana that flows through
them, and the bindu or thigle, the white and red seed-essences of the physical
body that form the basis for practices such as the Tummo.
    In the tantras of the Upadesa section of Dzogchen, it is explained that
after the conception of a human being the first thing to develop is the navel
cakra.  Then from this, through a channel, the head cakra develops followed by
the other main cakras of the throat and the heart.  This channel or meridian,
known as the life-channel, develops into the spinal cord and spine.  At the
same time it remains as the fundamental energy of the central channel.
    The central channel, known as Uma in Tibetan, is connected with the two
lateral channels called Roma and Kyangma.  The Roma channel, which is white
and corresponds to lunar energy, is on the right side in men and on the left
in women.  Ro means 'taste', and the main function of this channel is to give
the sensation of pleasure.  The Kyangma channel, red and corresponding to
solar energy, is on the left side in men and on the right in women.  Kyang
means 'sole', and unlike the Roma, this channel is not connected with many
secondary channels.  Control of this channel is fundamental in order to
cultivate the experience of emptiness.  These are the characteristic features
of the two channels, which are related to the two principles of upaya or
method, and of prajna or energy.  Method denotes everything pertaining to the
visible or material dimension; while 'prajna', which generally means
discriminating wisdom, in this context denotes the energy of emptiness that is
the base of any manifestation.

else had seven apertures, for sight, hearing, eating, breathing and so on,
Chaos had none.  So they decided to make the experiment of boring holes in

    Everybody loves to talk about calm and peace, whether in a family,
national, or international context.  But without inner peace how can we make
real peace?  World peace through hatred and force is impossible.  Even in the
case of individuals, there is no possibility to feel happiness through anger.
If in a difficult situation one becomes disturbed internally, overwhelmed by
mental discomfort, then external things will not help at all.  However, if
despite external difficulties or problems, internally one's attitude is of
love, warmth, and kind-heartedness, then problems can be faced and accepted.
                                 -----
    The necessary foundation for world peace and the ultimate goal of any new
international order is the elimination of violence at every level.  For this
reason the practice of non-violence surely suits us all.  It simply requires
determination, for by its very nature non-violent action requires patience.
While the practice of non-violence is still something of an experiment on this
planet, if it is successful it will open the way to a far more peaceful world
in the next century.

    On the tenth night of the twelfth month, Gyal Dawa, the girl, came again.
She said, "Don't neglect my request for a prayer.  It is very important."
That's the dream she had.  I thought, "I'll write it on the full moon day."
So on the night of the fourteenth I prayed with single-pointed devotion to
Guru Rinpoche to grant blessing that the prayer would be beneficial and then
fell asleep.  Early in the morning of the fifteenth I dreamed I was sitting in
front of the shrine in a very large building that looked like a temple.
Suddenly a young white man dressed in white with his hair falling loosely over
his shoulder appeared at the entrance.  He was playing the cymbals melodiously
and dancing the swirling, joyous dance of the Ging.  He came closer and
closer, singing:

        If you want to establish the dharma,
        Establish it in your mind.
        In the depth of mind, you will find Buddha.
        If you wish to visit the buddha fields,
        Purify ordinary deluded attachment.
        The perfectly comfortable buddha field is close by.
        Develop the joyful effort to practice,
        That is the essence of the teaching.
        Without practice, who can gain the siddhis?
        It is hard to see one's faults,
        But to see them nakedly is powerful advice.
        In the end when faults have been cleared away,
        The enlightened qualities increase and shine forth.

    At the end of this he rolled his cymbals.  Then he crashed them together,
and I awoke.  After I woke up, I did not forget what he had said.  I
understood it to have been advice on practicing what to accept and what to
reject.  I was sad that although I had actually seen the face of my only
father, Guru Padmasambhava, I had not recognized him.
    I, Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, old father of the Nyingma, wrote this from my own
experience.  Sarva Mangalam [May all be auspicious].

The modern economy has no national boundaries.  When we talk about ecology,
the environment, when we are concerned about the ozone layer, one individual,
one society, one country cannot solve these problems.  We must work together.
Humanity needs more genuine cooperation.  The foundation for the development
of good relations with one another is altruism, compassion, and forgiveness.
For small arguments to remain limited, in the human circle the best method is
forgiveness.  Altruism and forgiveness are the basis for bringing humanity
together.  Then no conflict, no matter how serious, will go beyond the bounds
of what is truly human.

    Creation in four vajra steps entails meditation on emptiness; generating a
moon, sun, and seed-syllable from which light emanates and then converges; the
full manifestation of the deity resulting from the convergence of the light
and transformation of the seed-syllable; and visualization of three syllables
at the deity's three places.  [The syllables om, ah, and hum are imagined at
the forehead, throat, and heart, respectively.]
    ...Kongtrul explains that all the varieties of the creation phase
incorporate the four key elements of form, imagination, result, and
transformative power.  "Form" means meditating on forms that represent the
aspects of awakening and generating clear images of these forms, thereby
stopping impure appearances.  "Imagination" means using the force of creative
imagination to convert the visualized forms of awakening into reality.
"Result" means meditating on the result, that is, the very goal to be
attained, and thereby achieving that goal.  "Transformative power" means
turning the ordinary body and mind into pristine awareness by relying on the
transformative powers of awakened beings.  Among these, Kongtrul points out,
the most important element for realization of the path is the transformative
power of the vajra master combined with one's own devotion to that master.

From The Prayer Requested by Namke Nyingbo
by Padmasambhava

All these things of the outer environment and the beings therein
That come into sight as the objects of your eyes like this,
They may appear, but leave them in the sphere free from clinging to a self.
Since they are pure of perceiver and perceived, they are the
luminous-empty body of the deity.
I pray to the guru in whom attachment is self-liberated,
I pray to Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

All these sounds, taken as pleasant or unpleasant,
That resound as the objects of your ears like this,
Leave them in the sphere of inconceivable, empty resonance.
Empty resonance, unborn and unceasing, is the Victor's speech.
I pray to the words of the Victor that resound and yet are empty,
I pray to Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

However these thoughts of afflictions' five poisons,
Which stir as objects in your mind like this, may appear,
Do not mess around with them through a mind that rushes ahead into the
  future or lingers in the past.
Through leaving their movement in its own place, they uncoil as the dharmakaya.
I pray to the guru whose awareness is self-liberated, I pray to
  Padmasambhava from Uddiyana.

Grant your blessings that the mind stream of someone like me is liberated
Through the compassion of the Tathagatas of the three times,
So that objects, appearing as if perceived outside, become pure,
That my very mind, perceiving as if inside, becomes liberated,
And that, in between, luminosity will recognize its own face.

    The actual method of cultivating the correct attitudes towards the
spiritual master is to practice contemplative meditation upon the guru's good
qualities and the beneficial effects that he or she introduces into one's
life.  By reflecting again and again on the great kindness the guru performs,
a confidence suitable for spiritual training under him or her is born.  This
process of reflecting on the role of the guru is important in the beginning as
well as in the higher practices, for as we sit in contemplation we become
faced with a stream of reactions, which if understood at an early stage can
clear the mind of much doubt, confusion and superstition.
    The spiritual master is the source of all spiritual progress.  In this
context, Geshe Potowa once said, "If even those who want to learn a common
worldly trade must study under a qualified teacher, how much more so must we
who seek enlightenment?  Most of us have come from the lower realms and have
no background or experience in the paths and stages to enlightenment; and, if
we wish to gain this experience, why should we not study with someone
qualified to teach us the methods that develop it?"
    In the beginning of his Great Exposition, Lama Tsongkhapa writes, "The
root of spiritual development is to cultivate an effective relationship with a
master." This means that we must cultivate the correct attitudes and then
demonstrate them correctly in action.  This is the root that, if made strong,
supports the trunk, branches, leaves and flowers of practice.  When the roots
of a tree are strong, the entire tree becomes strong, whereas when the roots
are weak, the entire tree will remain weak.
    ...We should engender respect such that we see the guru as a Buddha.  If
we can do this, then we experience the guru as we would a Buddha and
consequently are sufficiently inspired to practice what he or she teaches.
The instruction to see the guru as a Buddha is not unreasonable, for in many
ways the spiritual master is Buddha himself.

    ...when you start practicing, you should not expect too much.  We live in
a time of computers and automation, so you may feel that inner development is
also an automatic thing for which you press a button and everything changes.
It is not so.  Inner development is not easy and will take time.  External
progress, the latest space missions and so forth, have not reached their
present level within a short period but over centuries, each generation making
greater developments based on those of the previous generation.  However,
inner development is even more difficult since internal improvement cannot be
transferred from generation to generation.  Your past life's experience very
much influences this life, and this life's experience becomes the basis for
the next rebirth's development, but transference of inner development from one
person to another is impossible.  Thus, everything depends on yourself, and it
will take time.
    I have met Westerners who at the beginning were very enthusiastic about
their practice, but after a few years have completely forgotten it, and there
are no traces of what they had practiced at one time.  This is because at the
beginning they expected too much.  Shantideva's Engaging in the Bodhisattva
Deeds emphasizes the importance of the practice of patience--tolerance.  This
tolerance is an attitude not only towards your enemy but also an attitude of
sacrifice, of determination, soo that you do not fall into the laziness of
discouragement.  You should practice patience, or tolerance, with great
resolve.  This is important.

        I take refuge until I am enlightened in the Buddhas,
            the Dharma, and the Sangha.
        By the positive potential I create by practicing generosity
            and the other far-reaching attitudes (ethical discipline,
            patience, joyous effort, meditative stabilization, and wisdom),
        may I attain Buddhahood in order to benefit all sentient beings.

    It takes only a few moments to think in this way and to recite the prayer,
yet doing so has a significant effect on the rest of our day.  We'll be more
cheerful and will be sure of our direction in life.  Especially if we don't do
a regular meditation practice, starting the day in this way is extremely
beneficial.
    In the evening, after reviewing the day's activities and freeing our minds
from any remaining afflictions that may have arisen during the day, we again
take refuge and generate the altruistic intention.
    Before going to sleep, we can envision the Buddha, made of light, on our
pillow.  Placing our head in his lap, we fall asleep amidst the gentle glow of
his wisdom and compassion.  Instead, we can learn the guidelines and try to
implement them as much as we can, reviewing them periodically to refresh our
minds.  We may choose one guideline to emphasize this week in our daily lives.
Next week, we can add another, and so on.  In that way, we'll slowly build up
the good habits of practicing all of them.

    Despite all the material progress in this and the last century we still
experience suffering, especially in relation to mental well-being.  In fact,
if anything, the complex way of life created by modernisation or globalisation
is causing new problems and new causes of mental unrest.  Under these
circumstances I feel that the various religious traditions have an important
role to play in helping to maintain peace and the spirit of reconciliation and
dialogue, and therefore harmony and close contact between them is essential.
Whether we are believers or non-believers and, within the category of the
believers, whether we hold this or that belief, we must respect all the
traditions.  That's very important.
    I always tell people in non-Buddhist countries that followers of other
religions should maintain their own tradition.  To change religion is not
easy, and people can get into trouble as a result of confusion.  So it is much
safer to keep to one's own tradition, while respecting all religions.  I'm
Buddhist--sometimes I describe myself as a staunch Buddhist--but, at the same
time, I respect and admire the works of other traditionss' figures such as
Jesus Christ.  Basically, all the religious traditions have made an immense
contribution to humanity and continue to do so, and as such are worthy of our
respect and admiration.
    When we contemplate the diversity of spiritual traditions on this planet
we can understand that each addresses the specific needs of different human
beings, because there is so much diversity in human mentality and spiritual
inclination.  Yet, fundamentally, all spiritual traditions perform the same
function, which is to help us tame our mental state, overcome our negativities
and perfect our inner potential.

    ...For one who abides in thought
    Feats do not arise.
    Therefore abandon thought
    And think a mantra form.

'Abandon thought' refers to the eradication of thought conceiving self
[inherent existence] through the wisdom of selflessness; it does not mean to
stop any and all types of thought.  'Think a mantra form' means to meditate on
a deity.  The measure of firmness in deity yoga is indicated by 'whether
going, standing, or sitting is always immovable though moving about'.  When
one has attained the capacity to hold the mind on the divine body in all types
of behaviour--whether in meditative equipoise or not--without moving to
something else, one has the capacity to remove the pride of ordinaariness.

    A person who is liberated, who has freed his or her mind of all mental
afflictions, still experiences physical suffering.  The difference between us
and an arhat, a person who has freed the mind from mental affliction, is that
an arhat doesn't identify with pain.  Arhats experience physical pain vividly
but don't grasp onto it; they can take action to avoid or alleviate pain, but
whether they do so or not, the physical pain doesn't come inside.  What an
arhat does not experience is mental suffering.  A buddha, one who is perfectly
spiritually awakened, has gone a further step.  A buddha has no mental
suffering of his or her own, but is vividly and non-dually aware of the
suffering of others.
    Superficially, the arhat who is free from mental suffering can seem to us
who lack this realization as numb and detached, in a state of existential
anesthesia.  A buddha, one who is fully awakened, presents the paradox of
being free from suffering and also non-dually present with other people's joys
and sorrows, hopes and fears.  A buddha taps into immutable bliss, the
ultimate ground state of awareness beyond the dichotomy of stimulus-driven
pain and pleasure.  The mind of a buddha has been purified of all obscuration
and from its own nature there naturally arises immutable bliss, like a spring
welling up from the earth.  With the unveiling of the buddha-nature of
unconditioned bliss, there is also a complete erosion of an absolute
demarcation between self and other.  The barrier is gone.  This is why buddhas
are vividly and non-dually aware of the suffering of others, their hopes and
fears, the whole situation, and at the same time are not disengaged from the
purity and bliss of their own awareness.  The mind of a buddha doesn't block
out anything and nothing is inhibited, and this is why the awareness of an
awakened being is frequently described as "unimaginable."

    The fifth Tara is known as Wangdu Rigje Lhamo.  She is Kurukulle in
Sanskrit and Rigjema or Rigje Lhamo in Tibetan.  Wangdu means power of
"gathering, summoning," or "magnetizing." We can think of it as attracting
everything beneficial, to benefit all beings.  Rigjema means "she who
precisely understands everything" and Lhamo is "divine lady." So she is known
as the Tara who precisely understands the power of magnetizing.

  I hunted up statistics, and was amazed to find that after all the glaring
newspaper headings concerning railroad disasters, less than three hundred
people had really lost their lives by those disasters in the preceding twelve
months.  The Erie road was set down as the most murderous in the list.  It had
killed forty-six.or twenty-six, I do not exactly remember which, but I know
the number was double that of any other road.  But the fact straightway
suggested itself that the Erie was an immensely long road, and did more
business than any other line in the country; so the double number of killed
ceased to be matter for surprise.
  By further figuring, it appeared that between New York and Rochester the
Erie ran eight passenger trains each way every day.sixteen altogether; and
carried a daily average of 6,000 persons.  That is about a million in six
months.the population of New York city.  Well, the Erie kills from thirteen
to twenty-three persons out of its million in six months; and in the same
time 13,000 of New York's million die in their beds!  My flesh crept, my hair
stood on end.
  "This is appalling!" I said.  "The danger isn't in travelling by rail, but
in trusting to those deadly beds.  I will never sleep in a bed again."

The activities of this degenerate age are like a madman's performance of dance.
No matter what we do, there is no way to please others.
Think about what is essential.
This is my heart's advice.
  --Bhande Dharmaradza

  In any group of people, there is always some misunderstanding.  You cannot
satisfy everyone, no matter what you do.  The Bodhicaryavatara says that every
individual has a different way of thinking.  Thus, it is very difficult to
please everyone.  Even the Buddha could not do it, so how can we?  Instead of
trying to please others, please yourself by applying yourself fully to
bodhicitta.
  Investigate your situation carefully, according to the Dharma.  For us, it is
more important to know what is best than to know how to please everyone.  Know
what is right, and on the basis of your own wisdom and skill, just do it.
Don't expect that other people will be pleased with you or that they will be
happy about what you do.  Rather, do what's best, what's helpful for yourself
and for others.  If they are happy about it, that's fine.  If they are not
happy, what can you do?

Lochen Gyurme Dechen, nephew of the great accomplished master Tangtong
Gyalpo, sang this song, a prayer of the Six Doctrines, called "The Rain
of Great Bliss":

Nama Shri Jnana Daki Nigupta-ye!

  Lady of the celestial realms, compassionate one,
  Chief of wisdom dakinis, Niguma,
  When I, your child, pray fervently to you,
  In your expanse free from formulations, please think of me.
  Lady who reveals the sacred circle of great secrets,
  Bestow now the empowerment of the four joys!
  Lady who opens the door to the unborn state,
  Clear away now my negative acts and obscurations with the purification
    practice!
  Lady who emits fire from the short Ah,
  Burn now my soiled aggregates and sense elements!
  Lady who draws great bliss from the syllable Ham,
  Bestow now coemergent wisdom!
  Lady who reveals the natural experience of illusion,
  Destroy now my attachment to the reality of anger and desire!
  Lady who emanates and transforms during lucid dreams,
  Lady who makes spontaneous luminosity arise,
  Dispel now the darkness of my stupidity!
  Lady who leads above at the time of departure,
  Guide me now to the celestial realms!
  Lady who overcomes the appearances of delusion in the intermediate state,
  Grant me now the invincible body of enlightenment's perfect rapture.

This prayer was sung by the religious teacher Gyurme Dechen.

  ...ngondro, the foundational practices, are ways to bring body, speech, or
energy, and all aspects of mind into increasingly effortless harmony with the
oceanic expanse central to Dzogchen teachings.  This expanse is another name
for reality, the heart of our being, and thus for mind-nature.  Its vastness
challenges the cramped and reified self-images that temporarily obstruct our
view of the whole.  Finitudes of any kind--the sense of being small and
contained, the familiar urgent rush of business, passions, or plans--are
simply conceptions.  These conceptions are both cause and effect of energetic
holdings in the body.  The foundational practices illuminate these holdings
and, in the end, lead to their dissolution into the expanse.  As Khetsun
Sangpo Rinpoche has said, "Like a fire that burns fuel, the mind consumes
thought by working with it."
  In the Tibetan traditions, teaching and practice sessions typically open
with a reference, brief or extensive, to the foundational practices.  Every
lineage has its own variations, but the basic structure and principles of
these practices are virtually identical.  After an acknowledgment of one's
guru or lineage and the intention to benefit all beings, the sequence usually
begins with the four thoughts.  These are reflections on (1) the preciousness
of one's own life, (2) the fragility of life and the uncertainty of death's
timing, (3) the inexorable nature of karma, and (4) the impossibility of
avoiding suffering so long as ignorance holds one in samsara.  In addition,
there are two other contemplations: (5) the benefits of liberation compared to
life in samsara and (6) the importance of a spiritual guide.  These six are
known as the outer foundational practices.
  These six are combined with five inner practices, each of which is repeated
one hundred thousand times.  The first inner foundational practice is refuge.
Refuge, writes Adzom Drukpa, is the cornerstone of all paths.  Without it, he
adds, quoting Candrakirti, all vows come to nothing.  Most succinctly, refuge
helps us cultivate a quality vital to the path and to human interaction in
general: this is the quality of trust, the ability to fruitfully rely on
someone or something other than oneself.  Adzom Paylo Rinpoche once said that
whereas relying on others in the context of samsara generally leads us astray,
relying on the Dharma increases our good qualities.

1.18 Fruition of the Seed of Enlightenment

  When we engage in virtuous actions, we realize they are beneficial not only
for others, but also for ourselves.  Our good deeds can earn the praise and
appreciation of others, and the benefits of our work come back to us through
others.  When we are involved with virtuous works, people respect us and hold
us in high esteem.  And we know we must be doing something good, because we
experience a wholesome, pleasant feeling about our life's work.  We quickly
begin to see the short-term benefits of our involvement in virtuous action as
our bodies and minds become more peaceful in our daily lives.
  This serenity in turn increases our longevity as our body and mind become
more harmonized.  Even after our death, we will be reincarnated in higher
realms of existence as a result of our involvement with virtuous works during
this life.  Yet a higher rebirth is merely a short-term benefit, a temporary
relief from the sufferings of samsara, for until we achieve liberation from
samsara we remain trapped in the cycle of suffering, and "whatever goes up,
must come down!"
  Within the mundane world, when our evil deeds are common knowledge, no one
sings their praises.  If such deeds are remembered at all, it is in infamy.
However, when a being lives with a mind of true bodhichitta and does great
works of pure altruism, their deeds are remembered for centuries.  Of such
cases we have many examples within the Kagyu lineage alone: the historical
Buddha, Guru Rinpoche, Milarepa, the Karmapas, and countless others.  Yet it
is also important to remember that virtuous action eventually leads us to the
liberation of buddhahood; this is the ultimate long-term benefit of planting
the seed of enlightenment of which we speak.  Hence, as we make this journey
towards liberation, it is extremely important for us to learn to recognize
which of our actions are virtuous and which are not.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, addressing those who have or will undertake a
retreat, gives this advice:

  "You will fall sick, experience pain, and encounter many adverse
circumstances.  At such times do not think, 'Although I am practicing the
Dharma, I have nothing but trouble.  The Dharma cannot be so great.  I have
followed a teacher and done so much practice, and yet hard times still befall
me.' Such thoughts are wrong views.  You should realize that through the
blessing and power of the practice, by experiencing sickness and other
difficulties now, you are purifying and ridding yourself of negative
actions....  By purifying them while you have the chance, you will later go
from bliss to bliss.  So do not think, 'I don't deserve this illness, these
obstacles, these negative influences.' Experience your difficulties as
blessings...when you do experience such difficulties, you should be very happy
and avoid having adverse thoughts like, 'Why are such terrible things
happening to me.'"

  As Rinpoche advises, relating to hardship properly depends on the strength
of one's view.  In general, having a view is knowing exactly where you want
to go and how to get there.  It is the vision of knowing what you want.  For
example, if you have the view to become a doctor, your vision guides you
through financial burdens, physical and emotional difficulties, and obstacles
that get in your way.  You know it will be difficult and involve sacrifice,
but with a strong view, you forge to the finish line.
  Similarly, if you want to become spiritually awakened, it is the power of
your view that gets you there.  If you are having a hard time getting to the
meditation cushion, or engaging in the necessary study, it is because your
view is not strong enough or is incomplete.  A partial view, in this case, is
one that doesn't include hardship.  You can strengthen your view and
accelerate progress by understanding how you lose your view in the fog of
hardship, and therefore lose sight of your path.

  Under the heading of the great way's [Mahayana's] perspective, we read of how
the Buddha merely demonstrates the process of enlightenment in this world,
something he has done and will do repeatedly.  Kongtrul quotes the Buddha in
an important discourse:

  "In the past, countless ages ago, in a world-system that united as many
realms as there are grains of sand in the Ganges, I attained enlightenment as
Transcendent Buddha Crown of the Powerful One, aided beings, and transcended
sorrow.  Then once again, from that point until the present age, I have
repeatedly demonstrated the inconceivable process of enlightenment.
  "I will continue, until cyclic existence is empty, to demonstrate [this
process of] enlightenment beginning with the initial development of the mind
of awakening as an ordinary being."

  While such statements do not help us grasp the nature of the Buddha's
enlightenment, they do underline the fact that enlightenment is a specific
experience, the result of a known and knowable process that the Buddha
deliberately demonstrates time and again so that we might follow his example,
no guesswork involved.

Yang Gonpa says:

  The essence of thoughts that suddenly arise is without any nature.  Do not
inhibit their appearance in any way, and without thinking of any essence, let
them arise clearly, nakedly, and vividly.  Likewise, if one thought arises,
observe its nature, and if two arise, observe their nature.  Thus, whatever
thoughts arise, let them go without holding onto them.  Let them remain as
fragments.  Release them unimpededly.  Be naked without an object.  Release
them without grasping.  This is close to becoming a Buddha.  This is the self-
extinction of samsara, samsara is overwhelmed, samsara is disempowered, and
samsara is exhausted.  Knowledge of the path of method and wisdom, appearances
and emptiness, the gradual stages, the common and special paths, and the 84,
000 entrances to the Dharma is made perfectly complete and fulfilled in an
instant.  This is self-arisen, for it is present like that in the very nature
[of awareness].  Natural liberation is the essence of all the stainless paths,
and it bears the essence of emptiness and compassion.

  We must learn to trust ourselves when we practice the doctrines of the Buddha.
In time, we come to trust the infallibility of karmic cause and effect and of
the interdependence of all actions.  We must come to know and trust the
importance of the accumulation of merit and wisdom, in the same way we know
and trust that even the smallest drops of water falling into a bucket will
eventually fill it.
  We must learn to trust that our own dharma practice will remove our entire
jungle of kleshas [unwholesome qualities], much like knowing a raging wildfire
can clear an entire forest from the earth.  All of our negativities can be
swept away by the firestorm of our compassionate wisdom.  We must trust that
all of our happiness and sadness is completely dependent on, and a result of,
our previous karma; when we trust this process we can begin the accumulation
of virtuous actions immediately.
  No one achieves perfection in anything meaningful the very first time they
try; however, we've heard the phrase over and over again that "practice makes
perfect." It is true that with multiple repetitions and patience everyone can
achieve perfection over time.  I don't know of anyone who has sat down to
meditate for the very first time and immediately attained enlightenment, but
just like the drops of water that we trust will eventually fill our bucket,
consistent dharma practice will eventually lead us to liberation.

  Unbroken practice is like a watchful guard.
  It is simply unscattered and is free from acceptance or rejection.
  There is no duality of things to be abandoned and their antidotes.
  This is my heart's advice.

This verse and the following instructions concern how to continue with
Mahamudra practice.  Once we have received instructions, we have to accomplish
them and perfect the practice.  Continuity of practice is essential for the
perfection of enlightenment.
  Unbroken practice means that one is mindful all the time, like a watchful
guard.  Thieves and robbers may come at any time, so the guard of a mansion
containing great treasure must be alert twenty-four hours a day.  In the same
way, it is important to watch our mind since the thieves of attachment,
desire, anger, and forgetfulness can come at any time and steal the wealth of
our compassion and wisdom, along with our realization of Mahamudra.
  Once mindfulness is continuously established, an unscattered mind is "just
there," on the spot, whether we are walking, eating, driving, or performing
other activities.  We can watch the mind and see how our mental state shapes
our world.  But when we watch it, we should just relax.  Milarepa advises us
in a vajra song:

  Rest naturally, like a small child.
  Rest like an ocean without waves.
  Rest with clarity, like a candle flame.
  Rest without self-concern, like a corpse.
  Rest unmoving like a mountain.

  Every time we begin to practice, it helps not to plunge in right away.
Instead, take a few moments to stop your ordinary chain of thoughts.  This is
especially relevant if you are very busy and have only five minutes for your
daily practice, but even ordinarily we have this constant stream of thoughts.
Suppose that just before practice you have a fight with your fianc�.  This
will probably trigger a chain of thoughts about what you want to say to your
partner.  If you start your practice in the midst of all this, it is not going
to go so well.  This is why it helps to put a stop to this chain of thoughts
for just a few moments.
  I have found this to be very, very useful.  There are actually countless
methods for stopping the chain of thoughts, but for me, before I practice, I
just sit for a while.  Every time a thought comes along, I try to stop it by
cultivating a sense of renunciation, and I do this over and over again.  I
think about how I am now forty-years-old and, even if I live to be eighty, I
only have half of my life left.  I think that out of this forty years, I am
going to sleep the equivalent of twenty years.  So now there are only twelve
hours a day that could actually be termed living.  If we then factor in
watching at least one movie a day, eating, and gossip, we have maybe five
hours or so left.  Out of forty years that means eight years remain, and most
of that will go to indulging our paranoia, anxiety, and all that....  There is
actually very little time for practice!
  This should give you an idea of how to stop the chain of thoughts.  Don't
immediately throw yourself into the practice; instead, just watch yourself,
watch your life, and watch what you are doing.  If you are doing ten minutes
of practice every day, you should try to stop the chain of thoughts for at
least two to three minutes.  We do this to transform the mind by invoking a
sense of renunciation.  When we think, "I am dying.  I am coming closer to
death" and other such thoughts, it really helps.

Q: Does every kind of desire lead to pain?

A: Not all desire leads directly to pain.  However, the very word expresses
the sense of sticking to something.  It does not permit freedom.  It binds.
When attached and fastened to something, we cannot move far away.  It is as if
the desired object pulls us back, and we cannot free ourselves from it.  For
this kind of desire we use a term meaning attachment.  So long as we are
attached, we stick there and cannot achieve liberation.  However, this does
not necessarily entail chaos and pain.

Q: Does that mean that some desire is actually beneficial?

A: In the Tibetan language, desire names an attachment that harms ourselves
and others.  The source of benefit for ourselves and others receives a
different name; we call that "longing."

In Buddhism, there is a teaching called the "three bodies" (sanjin), also
called the "three properties" or the "three enlightened properties".  These
are the three kinds of form that a Buddha may manifest as: 1) the Dharma Body
(dharmakaya or hosshin) is the form in which a Buddha transcends physical
being and is identical with the undifferentiated unity of being or Suchness
(Skt.  tathata, Jp.  shinnyo); 2) the Bliss or Reward Body (sambhogakaya or
hojin) is obtained as the "reward" for having completed the bodhisattva
practice of aiding other beings to end their suffering and having penetrated
the depth of the Buddha's wisdom.  Unlike the Dharma Body, which is
immaterial, the Bliss Body is conceived of as an actual body, although one
that is still transcendent and imperceptible to common people; 3) the
Manifested Body (nirmanakaya or ojin) is the physical form in which the Buddha
appears in this world in order to guide sentient beings.  It is considered
that the historical Buddha, Shakyamuni, is nirmanakaya.  Honen believed that
Amida is sambhogakaya.

  Sometimes we put our glasses in our pockets or on our heads and later we ask,
"Where are my glasses?"  This is quite common.  We look everywhere else without
finding our glasses.  That is why we need the guru, who can say to us, "There
are your glasses."  That is all that the Mahamudra and Dzogchen teachers do:
they simply point out.  What they are pointing out is something that you
already have.  It is not something that they give you.  They do not give you
new glasses.  They cannot afford to give you new glasses, but they can afford
to point out where you can find your own glasses.
  When we receive pointing-out instructions from our root teacher, we are
being introduced directly and nakedly to the reality of mind's nature.  These
instructions become very effective if we have prepared ourselves to receive
them.
  ...Pointing-out is similar to pointing to the sky when it is very cloudy and
saying to someone, "There is the blue sky."  The person will look up and say,
"Where?"  You may reply, "It is there--behind the clouds."  The person to whom
you are pointing out the blue sky will not see it at first.  However, if even
a patch of blue sky appears, then you can say, "Look--the blue sky is like
that."  The person then gets a direct experience.  He or she knows
experientially that there is blue sky, which will be fully visible when the
clouds are gone.

  [At the time of Buddha, a farmer asked to be ordained as a monk.  Shariputra
did not see his merit.  But, with a great, compassionate mind, the Buddha took
his hand and said, "I will give you ordination.  You do have a seed to attain
arhatship...."]
  The Buddha explained, "Thousands and thousands of kalpas ago, this man was
born as a fly.  He was sitting on a pile of cow dung when a sudden rush of
water caught the cow dung, along with the fly, and sent them into the river.
Downstream, someone had placed a prayer wheel in the water, and that cow dung
and fly swirled around and around it.  Because of that circumambulation, this
man now has a seed to attain arhatship in this lifetime."
  Cause and result are so subtle that only omniscient wisdom can perceive
every detail.  That is why we must be very careful that our actions are truly
beneficial.
  Reciting just one mantra, protecting the life of even one small bug, giving
a small thing--we should not ignore such actions by saying, "This is nothing;
it makes no difference if I do it or not." Many small actions will gather and
swell like the ocean.  These are not merely Buddhist beliefs; these are the
causes that create our world no matter who we are.  Our study and practice
give us the opportunity to understand this and to be sincere with ourselves
even in small things.

...in Dzogchen, one applies specific practices in order to create a variety of
sensations, so that the practitioner is more clearly enabled to distinguish
the state of presence--which always remains the same--from the sensations
which change according to the practice being carried out.  This obviously
enables one to 'no longer remain in doubt' as to what the state of pure
presence is.  The practices known as the twenty-one Semdzin found in the
Dzogchen Mennagde, or Upadesha, series, have this particular function,
enabling the practitioner to separate the ordinary, reasoning mind from the
nature of the mind.

People often wonder how to reconcile the Buddha's teachings on non-attachment
with those on love.  How can we love others without being attached to them?
Non-attachment is a balanced state of mind in which we cease overestimating
others' qualities.  By having a more accurate view of others, our unrealistic
expectations fall away, as does our clinging.  This leaves us open to loving
others for who they are, instead of for what they do for us.  Our hearts can
open to care for everyone impartially, wishing everyone to be happy simply
because he or she is a living being.  The feeling of warmth that was
previously reserved for a select few can now be expanded to a great number of
people.

  Even in this world, and even now, there are said to be many hidden yogis or
discreet yogis, called bepay naljor in Tibetan.  It means those realized ones
who are not generally recognized as great spiritual sages or saints, but have
deeply tasted the fruit of enlightenment, and are living it.  Perhaps they are
anonymously doing their good works here among us right now!
  The infinite vast expanse is one's own inconceivable nature.  Who can say
who has realized it and who hasn't?  When we travel around the world or
experience other dimensions, there are so many beings who have tasted it.  We
can see it in their behavior, in their countenance, and in stories that are
told--not just in the Dzogchen tradition or the Buddhist tradition, but in any
tradition, and in our Western world too.
  This true nature is so vast and inconceivable that even some birds and
animals and beings in other unseen dimensions can be said to have realized it,
as in some of the ancient Indian Jataka stories and other teaching tales.  It
is always said that everything is the self-radiant display of the primordial
Buddha Samantabhadra.  There are infinite numbers of Buddhas and infinite
numbers of beings.  Who can say who is excluded from it?

  Many spiritual seekers are not yet ready to become the disciples of
spiritual mentors.  Their present levels of commitment may suit working only
with Buddhism professors, Dharma instructors, or meditation or ritual
trainers.  Even if they are ready to commit themselves to the Buddhist path
and to spiritual mentors, they may not yet have found properly qualified
mentors.  Alternatively, the spiritual teachers available to them may be
properly qualified and may even have shown them great kindness.  Yet, none
seem right to be their mentors.  They feel they can relate to them only as
their Buddhism professors.  Nevertheless, the Kadam style of guru-meditation
may still help such seekers to gain inspiration from these teachers at the
present stages of their spiritual paths.
  Unless our spiritual teachers are total charlatans or complete scoundrels,
all of them have at least some good qualities and exhibit at least some level
of kindness.  Our Buddhism professors, Dharma instructors, or meditation or
ritual trainers may lack the qualities of great spiritual mentors.  Still,
they have some knowledge of the Dharma, some insight from applying the Dharma
to life, or some technical expertise in the practice.  Our teachers are kind
to instruct us, even if their motivations contain the wish to earn a living.
If we correctly discern and acknowledge whatever qualities and levels of
kindness that our professors, instructors, or trainers in fact possess, we may
derive inspiration, through guru-meditation, by focusing on them with
conviction and appreciation.

  A tenth-century Bengali pandita named Palden Atisha reintroduced Buddhism
into Tibet.  He had a servant who was really awful.  He was abusive to Atisha,
disobedient, and generally a big problem.  The Tibetans asked Atisha what he
was doing with such an awful guy who was so completely obnoxious.  They said,
"Send him back.  We'll take care of you." Atisha replied, "What are you
talking about?  He is my greatest teacher of patience.  He is the most
precious person around me!"
  Patience does not mean suppression, and it doesn't mean bottling up our
anger or turning it in on ourselves in the form of self-blame.  It means
having a mind which sees everything that happens as the result of causes and
conditions we have set in motion at some time in this or past lives.  Who
knows what our relationship has been with someone who is causing us
difficulties now?  Who knows what we have have done to him in another life!
If we respond to such people with retaliation, we are just locking ourselves
into that same cycle.  We are going to have to keep replaying this part of
the movie again and again in this and future lifetimes.  The only way to break
out of the cycle is by changing our attitude.

[Understanding through the merging of sound and meaning takes place when one
immediately understands the meaning of a teaching through hearing the sound of
the words.]

  One might ask what these words are in the key instructions on the Three
Words That Strike the Vital Point.  The sound and the word are the same.  For
example, the word "mother" can be understood as indicating someone who is very
kind.  If one says "mother," the meaning of what that word expresses is
pointed out.  What is known as "the three words" is like that.
  What are the three words?  "View," "meditation," and "action." What does it
mean to "strike the vital point" with these three words?  If one wants to kill
a man and strikes his heart with a weapon, the man will not live another hour.
He will die immediately.  What vital point do these three words strike?  Just
as oil is present in a mustard seed, all of us, all sentient beings, have
buddha nature.  Though it is present, we do not recognize it, because our
minds are obscured by delusions.  When, as a result of the view, meditation,
and action, we come to recognize these delusions, we can get rid of them in a
moment.  In one day sentient beings can be transformed into buddhas--that is
the ultimate view, meditation, and action of dzogchen.  Such a power of
transformation is called "striking the vital point."

  If we can attain nondual, nonconceptual awareness in meditation, we are
engaged in profound political activity, even though we may lose this awareness
during the times we are not formally meditating (the buddha's awareness in
post-meditation is the same as during meditation).  Meditating in nondual,
nonconceptual awareness, which is meditating on the dharmadhatu, immediately
begins systematically to destroy in ourselves the structure of dualistic
consciousness with all its attendant cognitive obscurations and emotional
affiictions.  From the standpoint of duality, since this dualistic
consciousness also involves other sentient beings as the other pole of our
duality, our activity in dissolving this consciousness has a profound impact
on them as well.
  While our nondualistic, nonconceptual meditation is purifying our own
obscurations and afflictions and thereby transforming our personal experience
of others, it is also becoming a spark of buddha activity in those others.  As
our meditation becomes effective, the attitude of others towards us begins to
change, and they themselves begin to turn inward and to search with greater
conscientiousness through the stuff of their own minds and lives for spiritual
solutions to their own problems.  And as the power of our meditation
increases, this effect reaches ever-widening concentric circles of sentient
beings with whom we have karmic interdependence, which in this day and age
includes not only our immediate family and friends, working associates, and
local communities, but also everyone with whom we are connected through all
the media of our lives.

  Realizations come only if we practice joyfully, with confidence and courage.
Realization doesn't grow within a timid or weak state of mind--it blossoms in
the mind free of doubt and hesitation.  Realization is fearless.  When we see
the true nature of reality, there's nothing hidden, nothing left to fear.  At
last we're seeing reality as it is, full of joy and peace.
  ...Thinking of Tara will bring total calm, peace, and protection from all
fears and all frightening situations.  Tara's practice removes the two
obscurations: negative emotions and subtle conceptual thinking.  It will
increase the two merits: accumulation merit and wisdom merit.  From the moment
you start praying to and practicing Tara, your life will be always under the
protection of the Great Mother.  From then on rebirth in the lower realms will
be prevented.  If you do this prayer for others, it will bring them the same
benefits; it will protect them in their lifetimes as well as uproot future
births in the lower realms.  So there is great benefit.

6. Meditation on the Buddha
  Begin by observing your breath for a few minutes to calm the mind.
  Think of the qualities of infinite love, compassion, wisdom, skillful means,
and other wonderful qualities you aspire to develop.  What would it feel like
to have those qualities?  Get a sense of the expansiveness and peace of having
a wise and kind heart that reaches out impartially to work for the benefit of
all beings.
  Those qualities of love, compassion, wisdom, skillful means, and so on now
appear in the physical form of the Buddha, in the space in front of you.  He
sits on an open lotus flower, and flat sun and moon disks.  His body is made
of radiant, transparent light, as is the entire visualization.  His body is
golden and he wears the robes of a monk.  His right palm rests on his right
knee and his left is in his lap, holding a bowl of nectar, which is medicine
to cure our afflictions and other hindrances.  The Buddha's face is very
beautiful.  His smiling, compassionate gaze looks at you with total acceptance
and simultaneously encompasses all sentient beings.  His eyes are long,
narrow, and peaceful.  His lips are red and his earlobes long.
  Rays of light emanate from each pore of the Buddha's body and reach every
part of the universe.  These rays carry countless miniature Buddhas, some
going out to help beings, others dissolving back into the Buddha after having
finished their work.
  The Buddha is surrounded by the entire lineage of spiritual teachers, all
meditational deities, innumerable other Buddhas, bodhisattvas, arhats, dakas,
dakinis, and Dharma protectors.  To the side of each spiritual master is an
elegant table upon which are arranged volumes of Dharma teachings.
  Surrounding you are all sentient beings appearing in human form, with your
mother on your left and your father on your right.  The people you do not get
along with are in front of you.  All of you are looking to the Buddha for
guidance.

  If we investigate on a deeper level, we will find that when enemies inflict
harm on us, we can actually feel gratitude toward them.  Such situations
provide us with rare opportunities to put to test our own practice of
patience.  It is a precious occasion to practice not only patience but the
other bodhisattva ideals as well.  As a result, we have the opportunity to
accumulate merit in these situations and to receive the benefits thereof.
  The poor enemy, on the other hand, because of the negative action of
inflicting harm on someone out of anger and hatred, must eventually face the
negative consequences of his or her own actions.  It is almost as if the
perpetrators of the harm sacrifice themselves for the sake of our benefit.
Since the merit accumulated from the practice of patience was possible only
because of the opportunity provided us by our enemy, strictly speaking, we
should dedicate our merit to the benefit of that enemy.  This is why the Guide
to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life speaks of the kindness of the enemy.

  If our practice does not diminish self-grasping, or perhaps even enhances
it, then no matter how austere and determined we are, no matter how many hours
a day we devote to learning, reflection, and meditation, our spiritual
practice is in vain.
  A close derivative of self-grasping is the feeling of self-importance.  Such
arrogance or pride is a very dangerous pitfall for people practicing Dharma.
Especially in Tibetan Buddhism, with its many levels of practice, the exalted
aspirations of the bodhisattva path, and the mystery surrounding initiation
into tantra, we may easily feel part of an elite.  Moreover, the philosophy of
Buddhism is so subtly refined and so penetrating that, as we gain an
understanding of it, this also can give rise to intellectual pride.
  But if these are the results of the practice, then something has gone awry.
Recall the well-known saying among Tibetan Buddhists that a pot with a little
water in it makes a loud noise when shaken, but a pot full of water makes no
noise at all.
  People with very little realization often want to tell everyone about the
insights they have experienced, the bliss and subtleties of their meditation,
and how it has radically transformed their life.  But those who are truly
steeped in realization do not feel compelled to advertise it, and instead
simply dwell in that realization.  They are concerned not to describe their
own progress, but to direct the awareness of others to ways in which their own
hearts and minds can be awakened.

  What is method, within the context of the unity of method and wisdom?  It is
a dedicated heart of bodhichitta, based on love and compassion.  It apprehends
its object, enlightenment, with the intention to achieve it in order to
benefit others.  Compassion, as its basis, apprehends its object, the
suffering of others, with the wish to remove it.
  Wisdom, on the other hand, is a correct view that understands voidness--the
absence of fantasized, impossible ways of existing.  Even if it is aimed at
the same object as method, it apprehends that object as not existing in an
impossible way.
  The ways wisdom and compassion each apprehend their object are not at all
the same.  Therefore, we need to actualize these two, as method and wisdom,
first separately and then together.
  Even if we speak about the mahamudra* that is method and wisdom, inseparable
by nature in the ultimate tantric sense, the first stage for its realization
is understanding the abiding nature of reality.

  In Buddhism we speak of three types of phenomena: First, there are evident
phenomena that are perceived directly.
  Second, there are slightly hidden phenomena, which are not accessible to
immediate perception.  There are differences of opinion on this even within
Buddhist philosophy.  Generally speaking, we think this second type of
phenomena can be known indirectly by inference.
  One example of something known by inference is that anything arising in
dependence upon causes and conditions is itself subject to disintegration and
momentary change.  This momentary change is not immediately evident to your
senses.  You can look at something with your eyes, and it does not appear to
be changing right now, but by inference you can know that it is momentarily
changing.  This is an example of the second category of phenomena.
  Third, there are very concealed phenomena, which cannot be known by either
of the two preceding methods.  They can be known only by relying upon
testimony of someone such as the Buddha.

  Sometimes our life can feel devoid of meaning even though we may try in
different ways to put meaning into it....  Meaning comes when we go deeply
within, wait, listen, and open.  It begins to come when we genuinely open to
the suffering of those around us with a compassionate heart.  Equally, it
comes as we respond to the environment within which we live with care and
concern.
  The meaning or purpose to be found in bodhichitta is less associated with
what we do than with the quality we bring to what we engage in.  Small, simple
aspects of our life can be profoundly meaningful and have deep impact both for
ourselves and others.  Meaning lies in the quality of heart that we put into
what we do.
  It is not, therefore, the outer manifestation of what we can achieve that is
the root of meaning.  It is the undercurrent of bodhichitta's intention or
purpose and meaning that flows within.  What bodhichitta implies is that in
attuning to our buddha nature or buddha potential, we touch a source of
meaning in ourselves that will come through whatever we do.
  This root of meaning gives the bodhisattva the capacity to live a relatively
ordinary life and transform adverse circumstances into the path.  Even small
things become meaningful, like the way we respond to someone's distress or a
gesture of friendliness that lifts someone's day.  This deeper sense of
purpose is reflected in the care we give to our relationships and the
environment.
  Being present and responsive to what arises may mean that the eventual goal
of our sense of purpose is less crucial.  We are seldom, if ever, able to see
fully where our path will take us, and once we are open to the meaning present
in bodhichitta, the ego must surrender ambitions and allow the journey to
unfold.

  We have to admit impermanence into our lives.  It's important to live with
impermanence as a frame of reference so that we can approach each moment or
each day with a sense of humility about what we are able to do and what we are
not able to do and relinquish control over things we cannot have control over.
It is important to live as if things are as permanent as stone.
  You have to invest yourself in love and concern for people, accept people's
love as if that's the only thing that exists.  The commitment to living as if
everything is always there forever with the acceptance that nothing is going
to survive.

  The Tibetan controversies about instantaneous enlightenment through
recognition of the nature of the mind have been studied by David Jackson.
As he shows, it is mainly members of the Kagyu traditions in Tibet who have
maintained this doctrine, although it is certainly common in Chinese Ch'an
Buddhism and in the teachings of the Great Perfection in Tibet.  Dolpopa
quotes the position that is the object of his refutation: "Recognizing the
very essence naturally purifies them, without rejection."  This expresses the
view that through recognition of the essence of the thoughts as the dharmakaya
they are purified or dissolved into the dharmakaya, and also the idea that any
affliction that arises is actually a manifestation or self-presencing of
primordial awareness itself.  Thus there is no need to reject thoughts or
afflictions, which are naturally purified by means of the recognition.  This
type of viewpoint is widespread in Tibetan Buddhism.
  In contrast to these views, Dolpopa claims that the definition of an
ordinary sentient being or a buddha, and of samsara or nirvana, is determined
by the presence or absence of the incidental and temporary obscurations that
veil the true nature of reality.  It is not determined solely by recognition
of the nature of the mind or the thoughts.
  ...While the ground buddhahood of the dharmakaya and the resultant
buddhahood of the dharmakaya have not the slightest difference in essence,
they are distinguished as ground and result by means of the presence or
absence of incidental stains.

  We live in an ocean of cyclic existence whose depth and extent cannot be
measured.  We are troubled again and again by the afflictions of desire and
hatred as if repeatedly attacked by sharks.
  Our mental and physical aggregates are impelled by former contaminated
actions and afflictions and serve as a basis for present suffering as well as
inducing future suffering.  While such cyclic existence lasts, we have various
thoughts of pleasure and displeasure: 'If I do this, what will people think?
If I do not do this, I will be too late; I won't make any profit.' When we see
something pleasant we think, 'Oh, if I could only have that!'
  ...Day and night, night and day we spend our lives in the company of the
afflictions, generating desire for the pleasant and anger at the unpleasant,
and continue thus even when dreaming, unable to remain relaxed, our minds
completely and utterly mixed with thoughts of desire and hatred without
interruption.
  To what refuge should we go?  A source of refuge must have completely
overcome all defects forever; it must be free of all faults.  It must also
have all the attributes of altruism--those attainments which are necessary for
achieving others' welfare.  For it is doubtful that anyone lacking these two
prerequisites can bestow refuge; it would be like falling into a ditch and
asking another who is in it to help you out.  You need to ask someone who is
standing outside the ditch for help; it is senseless to ask another who is in
the same predicament.  A refuge capable of protecting from the frights of
manifold sufferings cannot also be bound in this suffering but must be free
and unflawed.
  Furthermore, the complete attainments are necessary, for if you have fallen
into a ditch, it is useless to seek help from someone standing outside it who
does not wish to help or who wishes to help but has no means to do so.

  If we were forced to choose between a sense of practical application and
learnedness, a sense of practical application would be more important, for one
who has this will receive the full benefit of whatever he knows.  The mere
learnedness of one whose mind is not tamed can produce and increase bad states
of consciousness, which cause unpleasantness for himself and others instead of
the happiness and peace of mind that were intended.  One could become jealous
of those higher than oneself, competitive with equals and proud and
contemptuous towards those lower and so forth.  It is as if medicine had
become poison.
  Because such danger is great, it is very important to have a composite of
learnedness, a sense of practical application and goodness, without having
learnedness destroy the sense of practical application or having the sense of
practical application destroy learnedness.

  A bodhisattva, having generated a sincere and spontaneous desire to attain
full enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, enters the Mahayana
path of accumulation.  Here the bodhisattva cultivates the four mindfulnesses
and develops mental quiescence, then passes on to the path of application,
where she or he strives for a conceptual insight into emptiness.  When
quiescence and insight are combined in examining emptiness, the bodhisattva
attains a direct, non-conceptual realization of emptiness, and thus becomes an
arya, on the path of seeing.
  The path of seeing corresponds to the first of the ten bhumis, i.e.  stages,
levels, or grounds said to be traversed by a bodhisattva.  The other nine
bodhisattva stages are coextensive with the path of development, during the
course of which the disciple completely eliminates not only the defilements
that are obstacles to liberation but even the traces of defilement, which are
obstacles to full enlightenment.
  When the path of development is completed, the disciple is ready to enter
the path of no-more-training; this marks the attainment of full enlightenment,
the dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya of an omniscient, compassionate,
and powerful buddha.

"If you fear you are running after the objects of the six senses, hold
yourself with the hook:"
  'Employ the watchman that is mindfulness.'

  Someone who has been captured with a hook has no option but to go wherever
he is led.  In the same way, if we catch hold of our mind--which risks being
distracted by the objects of the six senses--with the hook of mindfulness, and
with vigilance and carefulness, this will be of enormous benefit.  We should
use this watchman to constantly check how many positive or negative thoughts
and actions we produce during the day.  When we are able to control our minds
through mindfulness, everything that appears in samsara and nirvana becomes an
aid in our practice and serves to confirm the meaning of the teachings.  All
appearances are understood as being dharmakaya.  We perceive everything in its
natural purity, and there is nothing we can call impure.

  We need to understand the essential nature of the broad diversity of
phenomena.  For example, if we are obliged to be involved frequently with a
man who exhibits a personality that is true only on the surface, as well as
another basic personality, it is important for us to know both of them.  To
engage in a relationship with this person that does not go awry, we must know
both aspects of his personality.  To know only the facade that he presents is
insufficient; we need to know his basic disposition and abilities.  Then we
can know what to expect from him; and he will not deceive us.
  Likewise, the manifold events in the world are not non-existent; they do
exist.  They are able to help and hurt us--no further criterion for existence
is necessary.  If we do not understand their fundamental mode of existence, we
are liable to be deceived, just as in the case of being involved with a person
whose basic personality we do not know.

  One has to be cautious when one is very successful since at that time there
is danger of becoming prideful and becoming involved in the non-religious, and
one has to be cautious also when one has undergone lack of success and so
forth since there is a danger of becoming discouraged--the life of the mind,
so to speak, dying--due to which harm to one's practice could be incurred.
  ...Specifically, in situations of low self-esteem, Shantideva recommends
reflection this way:
    "Even very tiny bugs and worms have the Buddha nature and thus, when they
    encounter certain conditions, through the power of effort they can achieve
    the non-abiding nirvana of a Buddha.  Now, I have been born as a human with
    the capacity to understand what is to be adopted in practice and what is to
    be discarded; thus, there is no reason for me to be discouraged.  The great
    saints and so forth of the past who achieved a high level were people with
    a life-basis such as I have, not something separate."
  Through such reflection, a resurgence of will can be generated.

When we understand the evolution of our unsatisfactory experiences in cyclic
existence, we will see that meditating on emptiness is their antidote.  All
knowable things--people and phenomena--appear to our minds to be inherently
existent.  We then grasp at them as existing inherently.  Our inappropriate
attention focuses on them, and that gives rise to the various disturbing
attitudes of anger, attachment, and so on.  These disturbing attitudes
motivate our actions, which in turn leave karmic imprints on our mindstreams.
When these imprints ripen, we meet with suffering.

  The essential point about this condition of potentiality is that, although
there is a causal relationship between the physical world and the world of
mental phenomena, in terms of their own continuum one cannot be said to be the
cause of the other.  A mental phenomenon, such as a thought or an emotion,
must come from a preceding mental phenomenon; likewise, a particle of matter
must come from a preceding particle of matter.
  Of course, there is an intimate relationship between the two.  We know that
mental states can influence material phenomena, such as the body; and,
similarly, that material phenomena can act as contributory factors for certain
subjective experiences.  This is something that we can observe in our lives.
Much of our gross level of consciousness is very closely connected to our
body, and in fact we often use terminology and conventions which reflect this.
  For example, when we say 'human mind' or 'human consciousness' we are using
the human body as the basis to define a particular mind state.  Likewise, at
the gross levels of mind such as our sensory experiences, it is very obvious
that these are heavily dependent upon our body and some physiological states.
When a part of our body is hurt or damaged, for instance, we immediately
experience the impact on our mental state.  Nevertheless, the principle
remains that mental phenomena must come from preceding phenomena of the same
kind, and so on.
  If we trace mental phenomena back far enough, as in the case of an
individual's life, we come to the first instant of consciousness in this life.
Once we have traced its continuum to this point of beginning, we then have
three options: we can either say that the first instant of consciousness in
this life must come from a preceding instant of consciousness which existed in
the previous life.  Or we can say that this first instant of consciousness
came from nowhere--it just sort of 'popped up'.  Or we can say that it came
from a material cause.
  From the Buddhist point of view, the last two alternatives are deeply
problematic.  The Buddhist understanding is that, in terms of its continuum,
consciousness or mind is beginningless.  Mental phenomena are beginningless.
Therefore, the person or the being--which is essentially a designation based
on the continuum of the mind--is also devoid of beginning.

  Life is a party on death row.  Recognizing mortality means we are willing to
see what is true.  Seeing what is true is grounding.  It brings us into the
present and, eventually, into presence.  It also brings us into our bodies,
especially if we combine meditation on impermanence with an energetic
awareness at the base of the spine.  At first, the important thing about
impermanence seems to be the limited time we have in this precious life.  This
is crucial and foundational, and yet it is not the whole story.
  The teachings on impermanence concern the death of a self that never
existed.  Our sense of such a false and finite self, which initially is
inseparable from our wish to practice, can dissolve.  Understanding
impermanence, Khetsun Rinpoche says, will lead you into the natural clarity of
your own mind.  To know impermanence is thus not only a path leading to what
Dzogchen traditions speak of as "unbounded wholeness" (thigle nyag cig), it is
also integral to that wholeness.

  Now, you see, world peace through mental peace is an absolute.  It is the
ultimate goal.  But as for the method, there are many factors that must be
taken into consideration.  Under a particular set of circumstances, a certain
approach may be useful while under other circumstances another may be useful.
This is a very complicated issue which compels us to study the situation at a
particular point of time.  We must take into account the other side's
motivation, etc., so it is a very complex matter.
  But we must always keep in mind that all of us want happiness.  War, on the
other hand, only brings suffering--that is very clear.  Even if we are
victorious, that victory means sacrificing many people.  It means their
suffering.  Therefore, the important thing is peace.  But how do we achieve
peace?  Is it done through hatred, through extreme competition, through anger?
It is obvious that through these means it is impossible to achieve any form of
lasting world peace.  Hence, the only alternative is to achieve world peace
through mental peace, through peace of mind.  World peace is achieved based

People harm others only when they are unhappy.  No one wakes up in the morning
and says, "I feel so great today!  I think I'll go out and harm someone!" When
we can allow ourselves to know the depth of the pain and confusion felt by
those who have harmed us, compassion--the wish that they be free from such
suffering--can easily arise.  Thinking in this way does not mean whitewashing
or denying harm that was done.  Rather, we acknowledge it, but go beyond
amassing resentment, because we know that grudges help neither ourselves nor
others.

  The reason why the qualities of a teacher are described at such length in
the scriptures is because we should know what to look for when seeking a guru
capable of opening up the Buddhist paths within us.  To take up training under
an unqualified teacher can be disastrous.  It is said in the tantric
scriptures that one is not unwise to examine a guru for twelve years before
accepting that person as one's teacher.  The choice of teachers is an
important one and must be made carefully.
  Not only does the guru perform the work of the Buddhas and thus equal them
in activity, in terms of kindness the guru surpasses them.  Of all Buddhas of
the past who have manifested as universal teachers, it is said that Buddha
Shakyamuni is kindest to us; for it is with his teachings that we have come
into contact...even though Buddha Shakyamuni is most kind of the past Buddhas,
still we are unable to receive teachings from him or witness his inspiring
presence.
  Were all the Buddhas and lineage masters of the past to manifest before us
at this very moment, we would not be able to recognize them as enlightened
beings.  Due to our not having a sufficiently strong karmic connection with
them, they would be unable to affect us.  The guru performs the great kindness
of coming to us in an ordinary form which we can perceive and to which we can
relate, and carries out the work of the Buddhas in our lives.  The fact that a
donkey like us is brought into the family of spiritual beings is purely due to
the kindness of the guru.  The Buddhas can only come to us through him or her.
Thus if we do not respect the guru and heed his or her teachings, what hope do
we have?  We should meditate upon the guru's unexcelled kindness and give
birth to profound appreciation.
  The reason why we have been wandering unceasingly in cyclic existence since
time immemorial is because we have not met a spiritual master before; or even
if we have met one we did not cultivate an effective relationship with him or
her.  We should determine to take the opportunities afforded by our present
human situation and cultivate a spiritual practice under the guidance of a
master.

An exalting task for all humankind
  The West is fascinated by efficiency.  And there is no doubt that in many
areas its efficiency is quite admirable.  That is why I would like to ask this
question, which seems natural to me: why not apply this technical efficiency
to protect all forms of life?  This would be an exalting task for all
humankind, especially as we seem to lack a truly large-scale project or ideal.
It is difficult, yet it is absolutely necessary.  If the question of human
survival is not solved, there will be nobody left to solve the problem.  And
Buddhism can help here.

  If you continue to practice meditation, then your experience will gradually
increase and there will be greater and greater stability and greater and
greater lucidity.  However, the experiences that can arise in meditation can
take various different forms.  And in spite of the fact that the person has a
real recognition of the mind's nature, there is still the possibility or
probability of fluctuation in experience even after that.
  Sometimes you may feel that you have amazing, tremendous meditation, and at
other times you may feel that you have no meditation at all.  This
characterizes meditation experience, which fluctuates a great deal.
Realization, which is distinct from experience, does not change, but
experiences can fluctuate a great deal or alternate between good and bad.
There will still be times when you will have what you regard as good
experiences and, in contrast, what you regard as bad experiences.  When that
occurs, just keep on looking.  Don't get distracted or sidetracked by the
experience.  Whatever meditation experience arises, you should recognize that
it is transitory.  As is said, "meditation experience is like mist, it will
surely vanish."
  Experiences are different from the actual fact of the recognition itself.
Because they are ephemeral experiences, they aren't worth investing in.  So if
you have a bad meditation experience, do not be alarmed, because it too will
vanish.  If you have a good meditation experience, you need to continue; if
you have a bad meditation experience, you need to continue.  In either case,
you simply need to continue to rest in this recognition of the mind's nature.

  The person witnessing another person's suffering has only one appropriate
response: "How can I help?" When karma comes to fruition and causes suffering,
the response should never be, "This is your karma.  It's your destiny, so I
can't help." Your own karma may very well present itself as an opportunity to
help a suffering person.  Misunderstanding actions and their consequences can
be disastrous.
  From the Buddhist perspective, the type of fortune we encounter, happiness
or sorrow, is not due to somebody doing something to us.  If I win the
lottery, it is not because Buddha selected me for a bonus.  No god or buddha
is responsible for what happens to us....This does not imply that a suffering
person is morally degenerate any more than suffering the consequences of
eating contaminated food does.  The suffering we experience is due to karma
accumulated under the influence of delusion and mental afflictions.  This is
true for all sentient beings.
  The Buddhist response to the non-virtues we all commit while strapped to the
wheel of samsara can be inspiring and encouraging.  The Buddhist teaching is
that it is possible to neutralize negative karmic seeds embedded in the stream
of consciousness.  Deeds cannot be undone, but it is possible to purify one's
mind-stream so that the impact of karmic seeds will be nullified.
  The method used to purify the mind-stream is the "four remedial powers"
[remorse, reliance, resolve, and purification].  The metaphor for the
effectiveness of the four remedial powers is that of burning a seed.  Karma,
like a seed, can be scorched in the fire of purification so that it will not
sprout.  The seed won't vanish, but it will not sprout.

  ...it is said that through the power of believing one's own body, speech,
and mind to be undifferentiable from the deity's exalted body, speech, and
mind all one's physical actions and movements are seals and all one's speech
is mantra.  In this way the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra says:
  "A son or daughter of lineage* who has seen a mandala, who generates the
mind of enlightenment, who is compassionate, skilled in means and in teaching
the ways of letters--the door of Secret Mantra--should think thus, 'Separate
from speech, there is no mind.  Separate from mind, there is no speech.
Separate from mind, there is no divine form.  Mind itself is speech; speech
itself is mind; divine form itself is also mind, and speech itself is also
divine form.'
  "If a mantra practitioner believes in this way that these are
undifferentiable, he attains purity of mind.  At those times when he has a
pure mind, he always views in all ways his own body to be the same as the
deity's body, his own speech to be the same as the deity's speech, and his own
mind to be the same as the deity's mind; then, he is in meditative equipoise."

    Mind is empty like an illusion;
    Separate from body, it cannot achieve.
    Body also is like a wall;
    Separate from mind it is without activity.
    Similarly the yoga of seals....
      --Shriparamadhya

  Mind separate from body cannot openly display activities; body separate from
mind is the same.  Rather, actions must be done upon the aggregation of mind
and body.  Just so, here when practicing techniques for transforming basic--or
ordinary--body, speech, mind, and activities into those of the fruit stage of
Buddhahood, it is necessary both to cultivate (1) internal meditative
stabilization on a divine body, on a vajra on a moon disc at the heart, on a
seed syllable on a vajra in the throat, and on a vajra at the heart, and (2)
at the same time to construct the appropriate gesture, or seal, with the
hands.  These must be done in unison, for it is said in Yoga Tantra ritual
texts that if you fail to construct seals with the hands, the rite is
nullified.  Unlike on other occasions, it is not just that if the hand-seals
are constructed, it is better, but if not, there is no fault of nullifying the
rite.  Here, they must be done.

  Following the Vajrayana teachings, we do not give up or reject anything;
rather we make use of whatever is there.  We look at our negative emotions and
accept them for what they are.  Then we relax in this state of acceptance.
Using the emotion itself, it is transformed or transmuted into the positive,
into its true face.
  When, for instance, strong anger or desire arises, a Vajrayana practitioner
is not afraid of it.  Instead he or she would follow advice along the
following lines: Have the courage to expose yourself to your emotions.  Do not
reject or suppress them, but do not follow them either.  Just look your
emotion directly in the eye and then try to relax within the very emotion
itself.  There is no confrontation involved.  You don't do anything.
Remaining detached, you are neither carried away by emotion nor do you reject
it as something negative.  Then, you can look at your emotions almost casually
and be rather amused.
  When our usual habit of magnifying our feelings and our fascination
resulting from that are gone, there will be no negativity and no fuel.  We can
relax within them.  What we are trying to do, therefore, is to skillfully and
subtly deal with our emotions.  This is largely equivalent to the ability of
exerting discipline.

  Although we did not have the fortune to see Buddha Shakyamuni himself in
person, we do have the great fortune of having access to his own precious
teachings, which is actually superior to seeing him in person.  The same is
the case with masters like Nagarjuna and his immediate disciples.  If we make
the necessary effort, and undertake the practice and study, we can fully enjoy
a benefit equal to that of having met them in person.
  ...So visualize in space, in front of you, all the exalted masters,
including Buddha Shakyamuni, Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, eighty mahasiddhas, the
Nyingma masters, Atisha, the Kadampa masters, the five great masters of the
Sakya tradition, the lineages of Lamdre practice, the great masters of the
Kagyu lineage, such as Marpa, Milarepa, and also the great masters of the
Gelugpa lineage, Lama Tsongkhapa, and all of their followers.
  Around you also are the protectors who have taken the oath in the presence
of Buddha Shakyamuni to safeguard and protect the precious doctrine of Buddha.
Visualize as well the harmful spirits--actually an embodiment of your own
delusions--from which you are being protected by the guardians.  Also
visualize various emanations of the buddhas actively working for the benefit
of all living beings.  Surrounding you are all sentient beings...undergoing
the sufferings of their individual realms of existence.  Now generate a strong
force of compassion directed towards all these sentient beings, particularly
your enemies.
  Having created this mental image, question yourself as to how all these
objects of refuge, the buddhas and the masters of the past, achieved such a
high state of realization and reached a state where they can provide
protection to all living beings.  You will find that it is because of their
having made effort in the practice of dharma in general and, in particular,
the practice of bodhicitta*.  Think as follows: "I shall, from today, follow
in the footsteps of these great masters, and take the initiative of generating
bodhicitta."

  The question then is "How do we cultivate and develop this bodhicitta, the
mind of enlightenment?" The key, and the root, is great compassion.
Compassion here refers to a state of mind that makes it utterly unbearable for
us to see the suffering of other sentient beings.  The way to develop this is
through understanding how we feel about our own suffering.  When we become
conscious of our own suffering, we have a spontaneous wish to be free from it.
If we are able to extend that feeling to all other beings, through realizing
the common instinctive desire we all have to avoid and overcome suffering,
then that state of mind is called 'great compassion'.
  All of us have the potential to develop that kind of compassion, because
whenever we see people who are suffering, especially those close to us, we
immediately feel empathy towards them, and witness a spontaneous response
within our minds.  So all we have to do is to bring that potential out, and
then to develop it to become so impartial that it can include all sentient
beings within its embrace, whether friend or foe.
  To cultivate this great compassion within ourselves, first of all we need to
develop what is called loving-kindness, a feeling of connectedness or
closeness with all living creatures.  This closeness and intimacy should not
be confused with the kind of feeling we normally have toward our loved ones,
which is tainted by attachment...ego and selfishness.  On the contrary, we are
seeking to develop a feeling of closeness towards other sentient beings, and
affection for them, by reflecting on the fact that suffering is inherent in
their very nature, on the helplessness of their situation, and on the
instinctive desire they all have to overcome suffering.
  The greater the force of our loving kindness towards other beings, the
greater the force of our compassion.  And the greater the force of our
compassion, the easier it will be for us to develop a sense of responsibility
for taking upon ourselves the task of working for others.  The greater that
sense of responsibility, the more successful we will be in generating
bodhicitta, the genuine altruistic aspiration to attain buddhahood for the
benefit of all.

  Understanding the power of the path provides the inspiration that keeps us
going forward; exploring its pain provides the understanding of what holds us
back.  It doesn't take long to discover the power, nor to feel the pain.
Waking up hurts.  And if we don't understand why, we will run from the pain
and abandon the path.  There are countless people who have become spiritual
dropouts, or who are lost in detours because they have not understood
hardship.
  When your arm falls asleep, it prickles and burns as it returns to life.
Frozen fingers sting when they thaw; we jolt awake when the alarm clock rings.
But physical instances of anesthesia are mild compared to the anesthesia born
of ignorance, and so is the level of discomfort upon awakening.  The longer
something has been asleep, the more painful it is to wake it up.  If your
fingers are merely cold, it is easy to warm them up.  But if your fingers are
frozen solid, it hurts like hell when they thaw.  According to the traditions,
unless one is already a buddha, an "awakened one," one has been snoring from
beginningless time, and it can really hurt before we completely wake up.
Mingyur Rinpoche writes,
  "I'd like to say that everything got better once I was safely settled among
the other participants in the three-year retreat....  On the contrary,
however, my first year in retreat was one of the worst in my life.  All the
symptoms of anxiety I'd ever experienced--physical tension, tightness in the
throat, dizziness, and waves of panic--attacked in full force.  In Western
terms, I was having a nervous breakdown.  In hindsight, I can say that what I
was actually going through was what I like to call a 'nervous breakthrough'."

  As human beings we are deeply insecure and we do not know who we truly are.
Of course this problem does not show on the surface of our lives.  We are
always telling ourselves who we are, based on this notion that we are separate
from everything else.  This sense that "I am separate" is the ground of our
sense of self.  It is reinforced by various false identities that we cling to,
notions that "I am this" or "I am that." Whatever beliefs we have about
ourselves are just another extension.  Most of the time when we look around,
we immediately see that our surroundings are validating these false
identities.  For this very reason, it is a challenging endeavor to deconstruct
this illusion of self.
  Every time we look into our mirror we might have some thought about
ourselves.  Each of these thoughts adds up.  They become the conceptual bricks
we use to keep building this illusory castle of self.  Yet, there is a
suspicion that this notion of self might be very fragile and transient, and
this thought is silently lurking somewhere in our consciousness.  Most of the
time this suspicion is not brought into the light of awareness, but if it is,
some deep, inner wisdom will arise without choice.
  Our suspicion of the fragility of this false notion of self can go in one of
two directions.  In general it becomes a source of fear, anxiety, and
insecurity.  We often see people who are fearful and overly defensive when it
comes to their own identity.  We ourselves tend to become fearful if our
identity is threatened.  But at other times the suspicion can go another way.
When that happens, it can be a life-changing revelation that can lead us to
the realization of the highest level of truth.  This idea is not some new,
lofty theory.  It is timeless wisdom that has been realized by many people in
human history.  Buddha taught this wisdom, and in his tradition it is called
anatman or "no self." Anatman, or "no self," is the term used to mean that one
has seen through this false sense of self.  One has seen that this false sense
of self is merely an identification with one's roles in life.  It is just a
mask, not the truth.

  It is common worldly knowledge that by believing untrue information to be
true we fall into confusion and are harmed.  Similarly, by believing phenomena
to be inherently existent when in fact they are not inherently existent, we
are also harmed.  For example, with respect to the different ways in which
there can be a consciousness of 'I', there is a definite difference between
the way the 'I' is apprehended when desire, hatred, pride and so forth are
generated based on this 'I', and the way the 'I' is apprehended when we are
relaxed without any of those attitudes being manifest.
  Similarly, there is the mere consciousness that apprehends an article in a
store before we buy it, and there is the consciousness apprehending that
article after it has been bought, when it is adhered to as 'mine' and grasped
with attachment.  Both these consciousnesses have the same object, and in both
cases the mode of appearance of the article is the appearance of it as
inherently existent.  However, there is the difference of the presence or
absence of our adhering to it as inherently or independently existent.
  ...a consciousness conceiving inherent existence precedes any bad
consciousness, leading it on by the nose, and also accompanies, or aids, many
other bad consciousnesses as well.  Thus, if there were no ignorance
conceiving inherent existence, then there would be no chance for desire,
hatred and so forth to be generated.

Avoid Sidetracks

  As practitioners we will face many obstacles and sidetracks on our path to
liberation, and these will provide us with many challenges along the way.  We
shouldn't allow our practice to become interrupted due to these obstacles and
sidetracks, such as the appearance and disappearance of the many friends we
will have over the course of our lives.
  We also shouldn't allow our practice to become interrupted by a change in
the availability or quality of food and shelter.  And we shouldn't allow our
practice to become interrupted by the obstacles and sidetracks presented by
the many distractions of mind that are readily available in the mundane world
of our external environment.  We shouldn't allow our practice to be
interrupted by obstacles and sidetracks that arise due to the desire and
attachment we feel for loved ones, or our aversion to enemies, or our
indifference towards others.  Finally, we should not allow our practice to
become interrupted by our desire to accumulate wealth, or by our attachment to
our material possessions.  Only an advanced practitioner, motivated by deep
bodhichitta, can get through these obstacles and avoid these sidetracks to
reach their goal of liberation from samsara.

  Cultivating an aspiration to help other sentient beings becomes a cause for
wanting to achieve Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings.  These are
the two levels of the awakening mind of bodhichitta.
  Such a mind cannot be cultivated in a mere few months or years, but this
does not mean it cannot be cultivated at all.  If you continue your practice
to cultivate bodhichitta, a time will come when you will be successful.  For
example, in the initial stage you may not even understand the meaning of the
word bodhichitta.  You might wonder how you could ever cultivate such a mind.
But through repeated practice and familiarity, you will gradually come closer
to such a mind.
  It is the nature of conditioned things that they change depending on causes
and conditions.  So it is important to recall the advantages and benefits of
such a mind and cultivate a strong determination to achieve it.  Make ardent
prayers.  Whether you sleep, walk, or sit, you should think: "How good it
would be if I could cultivate such a mind." Try to cultivate bodhichitta even
on an aspirational level.  If you spend your days in such repeated and
persistent practice, you can definitely develop it.  Make the determination to
cultivate it even if it will take many aeons.  As Shantideva prays in his
Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life:

    As long as space endures
    And as long as sentient beings remain,
    May I too abide
    To dispel the sufferings of all sentient beings.

  The theory of dependent-arising can be applied everywhere.  One benefit of
applying this theory is that viewing a situation this way gives you a more
holistic picture, since whatever the situation is--good or bad--it depends on
causes and conditions.  An event is not under its own power but depends on
many present causes and conditions as well as many past causes and conditions.
Otherwise, it could not come into being.
  When you think from this viewpoint, you can see much more of the whole
picture, and from this wider perspective, you can see the reality of the
situation, its interdependence.  With the help of this relational outlook, the
action that you take will be realistic.
  ...Failure to look at the whole picture means realism is lost.  The attitude
that money alone is sufficient leads to unforeseen consequences.  Money is
certainly necessary; for instance, if you thought that religious retreat in
meditation alone was sufficient, you would not have anything to eat.  Many
factors have to be considered.  With awareness of the fuller picture, your
outlook becomes reasonable, and your actions become practical, and in this way
favorable results can be achieved.

Fear and Fearlessness.

  Perhaps the first reaction we have to our own suffering is fear.  Fear
arises in us almost automatically when we experience strong emotions or pain.
We don't have to sit there and generate fear--it just arises.  When we
experience a disturbing emotion such as jealousy we think, "No, I don't want
this."  We would rather not experience it.  However, if we examine fear
closely, we see that it is a thought to which we have been habituating our
mind for a very long time.  We have repeated this thought pattern of fear for
many years, and from a Buddhist point of view, many lifetimes.
  In just the same way, when we habituate our minds to being fearless, to
being brave and open towards our emotions, fearlessness will also arise
naturally.  In order for this to happen, we must train in applying antidotes
to our thought patterns that are caught up in fear.  In this way, we transcend
fear first through a conceptual process, which later becomes nonconceptual, a
natural fearlessness.  In order to become fearless in this way, we need
determination and the willingness to face our emotions.  With that strong
determination and courage, fearlessness will arise effortlessly.

  There is both a reason and a purpose for cultivating the meditative
stabilization observing exhalation and inhalation of the breath.  The reason
is mainly to purify impure motivations.  What exactly is to be purified?  The
main of these are the three poisons--desire, hatred, and obscuration.  Even
though we have these at all times and even though the meditator will still
retain them, she or he is seeking to suppress their manifest functioning at
that time.  The specific purpose for cleansing impure motivations before
meditation is to dispel bad motivations connected with this lifetime, such as
having hatred toward enemies, attachment to friends, and so forth.
  In terms of the practice I am explaining here, even the thought of a
religious practitioner of small capacity is included within impure
motivations; such a person engages in practice mainly for the sake of a good
future lifetime.  Similarly, if on this occasion one has the motivation of a
religious practitioner of middling capacity--that of only oneself escaping
from cyclic existence, this is also impure.
  What is a pure motivation?  To take as one's aim the welfare of all sentient
beings.  This is the motivation of a religious practitioner of great capacity.
Meditators should imagine or manifest their own impure motivation in the form
of smoke, and with the exhalation of breath should expel all bad motivation.
When inhaling, they should imagine that all the blessings and good qualities
of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, in the form of bright light, are inhaled into
them.  This practice is called purification by way of the descent of ambrosia.
There are many forms of this purification, but the essence of the practice is
as just indicated.

  Tsongkhapa pays homage to the "foremost holy lamas," for it is in dependence
upon a qualified lama that the three principal aspects of the path are
realized.
  The high title "lama" alone does not qualify someone as a lama; the good
qualities associated with the title must also be present.  The three words--
foremost, holy, and lama--set forth the three qualities of a lama.
  "Foremost" describes a person who has diminished emphasis on this lifetime
and is primarily concerned with future lifetimes and deeper topics.  Such a
person has a longer perspective than the shortsighted one of those who mainly
look to the affairs of this life and thus, in relation to common beings whose
emphasis is mainly on this life, is the foremost, or a leader.
  "Holy" refers to one who, as a result of developing renunciation for all
forms of cyclic existence, is not attached to any of its marvels and is
seeking liberation.  A holy person has turned his or her mind away from
attachment outside to the better things of cyclic existence and focused it
within.
  In the word "lama", "la" means high, and "ma" is a negative, which indicates
that there is none higher; this is a person who has turned away from self-
cherishing to cherishing others, has turned away from the lower concern for
personal benefit in order to achieve the higher purpose of attaining benefit
for others.

...beginning with an attitude
Of love for all living creatures,
Consider beings, excluding none,
Suffering in the three bad rebirths,
Suffering birth, death and so forth.

  The" attitude of love" to which the text refers is the affection which sees
all living beings as lovable.  The stronger our affection the more easily
compassion arises and the more intense and steadfast it is.  Compassion can
arise without it, but it will not be consistent.  Unless we see all living
beings as near, dear, appealing and beloved, we won't care what happens to
them.  On the contrary, we may even wish more suffering on those we dislike.
That affection is what a doting mother feels for the apple of her eye, what a
dog-owner feels for a beloved pet--a warm feeling that makes you want to hug
and pat and say, "Adorable!"
  At present our feelings of affection are restricted to those we like and,
even then, vanish quite quickly if they do something that goes against our
wishes.  It's a tall order to ask us to feel affection toward all living
beings.  It doesn't come naturally, which is why we need to train ourselves to
see them in a new way.

  Why should one work so hard to please people, doing all sorts of things for
others in order to make them feel happy?  If one can't bear one's enemy's
happiness, then why should one do all sorts of things to make anyone else
happy?
  Shantideva explains an inconsistency regarding this issue.  He notes that
when praise is directed toward oneself, when people speak highly of oneself,
one not only feels happy but also expects others to be happy when they hear
this praise.  However, this is totally inconsistent with one's attitude toward
others.  When people praise others, then not only does one disapprove of
others' happiness but one's own peace of mind and happiness are destroyed as
well.  So there seems to be an inconsistency when it comes to relating to
praise directed toward oneself and praise directed toward others.
  Then, especially for a Bodhisattva practitioner who has dedicated his or her
life to bringing about joy and happiness in others and leading them to the
ultimate state of happiness, to be jealous of others' happiness and joy is
totally inappropriate.  In fact, one should feel that if other sentient beings
of their own accord, from their own efforts, gain any little experience of
happiness and joy here and there, we should be all the more grateful, because
without our helping them, they have been able to achieve these joyful
experiences and happiness.

  What is meant by going for refuge is that you are seeking refuge from some
fear.  All the objects [Buddha, lama, guru, etc.] in front of you are what is
known as the causal refuge, because they serve as the cause for bringing about
the resultant refuge within you.  You should entrust yourself to these objects
from the depth of your heart, and you should see the objects as protectors.
The resultant state of your own future realizations, becoming an arya being
and attaining buddhahood--which depends on your own actualization of the path-
-is called the resultant refuge.  Someone in difficulty seeking the assistance
of a high official is analogous to someone seeking refuge in the causal
refuge.
  But depending upon others' protection forever is not a courageous way of
life; therefore, one has to try to achieve a state where one is no longer
dependent upon such a refuge, and this is likened to taking refuge in the
resultant buddha, dharma, and sangha.  That is the process of taking refuge by
a person of high faculty and courage.  This practice should be done not for
the sake of oneself alone but rather for the sake of all other sentient
beings.  When you cultivate such an aspiration focused toward the achievement
of the omniscient state, it is very much like the generation of the
bodhichitta mind.

  Many of the methods of practicing Dharma that are learned during waking can,
upon development of dream awareness, be applied in the dream condition.  In
fact, one may develop these practices more easily and speedily within the
Dream State if one has the capacity to dream lucidly.  There are even some
books that say that if a person applies a practice within a dream, the
practice is nine times more effective than when it is applied during the
waking hours.
  The dream condition is unreal.  When we discover this for ourselves within
the dream, the immense power of this realization can eliminate obstacles
related to conditioned vision.  For this reason, dream practice is very
important for liberating us from habits.  We need this powerful assistance in
particular because the emotional attachments, conditioning, and ego
enhancement which compose our normal life have been strengthened over our
many, many years.
  In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like the
images of a dream.  If we examine them well, the big dream of life and the
smaller dreams of one night are not very different.  If we truly see the
essential nature of both, we will find that there really is no difference
between them.  If we can finally liberate ourselves from the chains of
emotions, attachments, and ego by this realization, we have the possibility of
ultimately becoming enlightened.

Cultivating Memory and Joyful Effort

  [This] foundational practice is engaged upon awaking in the morning.  It
further cultivates strong intention and also strengthens the capacity to
remember the events of the night.
  Begin by reviewing the night.  The Tibetan term for this preparation is
literally "remembering."  Did you dream?  Were you aware that you were in a
dream?  If you dreamt but did not attain lucidity, you should reflect, "I
dreamt but did not recognize the dream as a dream.  But it was a dream."
Resolve that next time you enter a dream you will become aware of its true
nature while still in the dream.
  If you find it difficult to remember dreams, it can be helpful, throughout
the day and particularly before sleep, to generate a strong intention to
remember dreams.  You can also record dreams in a notepad or with a tape
recorder, as this will reinforce the habit of treating your dreams as
something valuable.  The very act of preparing the notebook or recorder at
night serves to support the intention to recall the dream upon waking.  It is
not difficult for anyone to remember dreams once the intention to do so is
generated and sustained, even over just a few days.
  If you did have a lucid dream, feel joy at the accomplishment.  Develop
happiness relative to the practice and resolve to continue to develop the
lucidity the following night.  Keep building intention, using both successes
and failures as occasions to develop ever stronger intent to accomplish the
practice.  And know that even your intention is a dream.

  On some occasions, people faint.  Even when your breath temporarily stops,
during that moment, there is a reduced level of consciousness.  Consciousness
is most reduced late in the course of dying.  Even after all physical
functions cease, we believe that the "I," or "self," still exists.  Similarly,
just at the beginning of life, there must be a subtle form of consciousness to
account for the emergence of consciousness in the individual.
  We must explore further the point at which consciousness enters into a
physical location.  At conception, the moment when and the site where
consciousness interacts with the fertilized egg is something to be discovered,
although there are some reference to this in the texts....  The Buddhist
scriptures do deal with it, but I am interested to see what science has to say
about this.  During this period we believe that without the subtle
consciousness, there would be a life beginning without consciousness.  If that
were the case then no one could ever recollect experiences from their past
life.  It is also in terms of Buddhist beliefs relating to this topic that
Buddhism expounds its theory of cosmology: how the universe began and how it
later degenerates.
  Based on this metaphysical reasoning and other arguments, and based on the
testimony of individuals who are able to recollect their experiences in past
lives very vividly, Buddhists make this claim.  I am a practitioner, so based
on my own limited experiences, and the experiences of my friends, I cannot say
with one hundred percent certainty that there is a subtle consciousness.
  Scientists don't posit consciousness in the same sense that Buddhists do.
At the moment of conception, however, there has to be something that prevents
the sperm and egg from simply rotting, and causes it to grow into a human
body.  When does that occur?  Why does that occur?

Taking the reins is the key to happiness
~
  The state of mind of a Buddhist practitioner should be stable, and should
not be subject to too many conflicting events.  Such a person will feel both
joy and pain, but neither will be too weak or too intense.  Stability is
developed through discipline.  The heart and mind become more full of energy,
more resolute, and therefore less susceptible to being blown about by outside
events.
  Deep within the human being abides the wisdom that can support him or her in
the face of negative situations.  In this way, events no longer throw him
because he is holding the reins.  Similarly, when something good happens it is
also possible to rein it in.  Taking the reins is the key to happiness.  In
Tibet we have a saying: "If you are beside yourself with joy, tears are not
far behind." This shows how relative what we call joy and pain are.

     Peace: The Essential Life and Teachings"

  From a Buddhist perspective, busying ourselves with worldly activities is a
form of laziness, because we're lax in self-cultivation.  Our lives are so
busy in modern society: Our appointment books are completely full and we're
always running here and there.  We often complain there isn't enough time for
the Dharma.
  However, whenever we have a spare moment, we work overtime or call some
friends to fill in the gap.  We always have time to eat, but we hardly ever
have time to nourish ourselves spiritually by attending Dharma classes or
meditating.  When the temple has entertainment and free meals, we go; but when
there is meditation or lessons, we're busy.
  This hindrance to spiritual progress comes because we're attached to worldly
pleasures: food, money, reputation, amusement, and friends.  The harm comes
from our inappropriate way of relating to them.  Attached, we selfishly
indulge in them.  However, these things in and of themselves aren't bad.
Through pacifying our afflictions, we can enjoy these things with a good
motivation--to improve ourselves for the benefit of others.

  It is important to note that we should make sure that our meditation suits
our mind.  If we feel comfortable doing analytical meditation on the various
topics in a progressive way, we should go ahead with it.  If, on the other
hand, we find it difficult and it is not compatible with our mind, we should
meditate on whatever topic we like.
  If we enjoy meditation on emptiness, we should go ahead with this.  If it
suits us and we derive pleasure from meditating principally on the altruistic
intention, we can emphasize this.  At some point if we find that we cannot
really get into whatever analytical meditation we have been doing, but doing
prostrations, chanting mantra, visualizing a meditation deity, or reciting
aspirational prayers brings peace and pleasure to our mind, we should do that
practice.

  Attaining realization is not such a long path once we become able to
integrate all our movements of energy in our practice, because then every
action is governed by presence and becomes a step on the path and an
expression of virtue.
  Practice is not only sitting in meditation, reciting mantras, or chanting.
It is the application of practice in daily life that is most difficult,
working with our energy in every life situation, with every sense perception,
with every person we meet, whether we want to encounter that person or not.

When we focus our attention on the passage of breath, we break the usually
continuous flow of thoughts of attachment, hostility and so forth, whatever
they might be.  This causes such thoughts to subside for the moment.  Thus, by
occupying the mind with our breath, we cleanse it of all positive and negative
conceptual thoughts and thus remain in a neutral state of mind unspecified as
either constructive or destructive.  This is the meaning of the line in the
root text, "Thoroughly clean out your state of awareness." This unspecified or
neutral state of mind, cleaned out of all positive and negative conceptual
thoughts, is the most conducive one to work with.  Because an unspecified
state of mind like this is unburdened and supple, it is relatively easy to
generate it into a constructive state.

    "You may ask: If there is no sentient being, whose is the goal?  We grant
    that desire [for liberation, etc.] is indeed delusive.  Still, in order to
    eradicate suffering, effective delusion, whose result [is understanding of
    the ultimate] is not prevented."

Objection:
  If sentient beings do not exist, who is it that attains the fruition of the
spiritual path--full awakening?  And while on the path, for whom does one
cultivate compassion?

Response:
  Sentient beings do exist.  It is for them that compassion is felt, and
compassion is cultivated by existent people.  Whatever is designated by
delusion is to be acknowledged.  Due to cultivating compassion while on the
spiritual path, the fruition of full awakening is attained.  Who attains
awakening?  That, too, is to be established conventionally, without [ultimate]
examination or analysis.  In order to pacify the suffering of oneself and
others, impure appearances that arise due to ignorance are not to be rejected.

  The object of meditation this time is emotion.  In other words, we
specifically focus on the emotions that arise from our feelings of good, bad,
and indifferent.  In the first of the equanimity meditations, we made the
choice to not follow up these emotions.  This time we make the choice to
meditate on them.  We might choose to meditate on sensations and feelings that
arise in our immediate, present environment.  We might also choose to meditate
on an event or person that sets off strong sensations, feelings, and emotions.
  Let's say you choose to base your meditation on an event such as a family
argument.  This time you contemplate an aspect of that event and try to
disentangle the sensations, feelings, and emotions.  Sensations are what you
feel with your body.  Feelings assess whether that sensation is nice, nasty,
or neutral.  What emotions arise as a result of those sensations and feelings?
  As we now know, equanimity means not getting caught in further
exaggerations: "Oh, I am so bad because this is what I did," "Look how good I
am," "How could anyone love someone like me?" and so on.  In this meditation,
equanimity means not judging whether we are good or bad people, but just
noting what happened.

  Everyone tries to remove superficial pain, but there is another class of
techniques concerned with removing suffering on a deeper level--aiming at a
minimum to diminish suffering in future lives and, beyond that, even to remove
all forms of suffering for oneself as well as for all beings.  Spiritual
practice is of this deeper type.
  These techniques involve an adjustment of attitude; thus, spiritual practice
basically means to adjust your thought well.  In Sanskrit it is called dharma,
which means "that which holds." This means that by adjusting counterproductive
attitudes, you are freed from a level of suffering and thus held back from
that particular suffering.  Spiritual practice protects, or holds back,
yourself and others from misery.
  From first understanding your own situation in cyclic existence and seeking
to hold yourself back from suffering, you extend your realization to other
beings and develop compassion, which means to dedicate yourself to holding
others back from suffering.  It makes practical sense...by concentrating on
the welfare of others, you yourself will be happier.

  In his closing discussion on loving-kindness, Buddhaghosa asks: "What is the
proximate cause of loving-kindness?" The answer is the observation of
lovableness in the person to whom you are attending.
  Bring to mind right now someone whom you find lovable.  It could be a person
you have a romance with, or a child, or a dear friend, or a great teacher--
someone to whom your heart would leap like a deer in the forest if this person
were to walk through the door, someone whose presence is so lovable that a
gladness arises on seeing him or her.  If you can sense that in a dear friend,
then try to seek out the lovableness of a neutral person.  Then, finally, when
you break down all the barriers, see it in a person who has done you injury.
  It's a great key if you can seek out something to love, even in the enemy.
Bear clearly in mind that this does not endorse or embrace evil.  The crucial
point here is to be able to slice through like a very skilled surgeon,
recognizing vicious behavior that we would love to see annihilated as separate
from the person who is participating in it.  The doctor can be optimistic.  A
cure is possible: the person is not equivalent to the action or the
disposition.  Moreover there is something there that we can hold in affection,
with warmth.  That really seems to be a master key that can break down the
final barrier and complete the practice.
  One way of approaching this is to look at the person you hold in contempt,
and try to find any quality he might share with someone you deeply admire and
respect.  Is there anything at all noble to be seen, anything that would be
akin to what a truly great spiritual being would display?  Focus on that:
There is something there that you can love.  The rest is chaff, that hopefully
will be blown away quickly, to everyone's benefit.  It is as if you could see
a little ray of light from within, knowing that its source is much deeper than
the despicable qualities on the outside.  That light is what you attend to.

Question: I have the strong wish to be reborn in any of the realms in a
position to truly help other sentient beings in that realm.  Is it wrong for
me in these circumstances not to have the strong wish to leave the wheel of
cyclic existence?

Answer: Your wish to stay in order to help is certainly right.  One of
Shantideva's prayers, roughly translated is, "As long as there is space, I
will remain with sentient beings, to serve and help them." Therefore, I also
am trying to practice this.  Helping others is the real purpose of life; it
will bring the most satisfaction.  The one action of helping others out of a
sincere motivation brings two results--satisfaction for yourself and benefit
to others.  It is most beautiful.
  One might ask whether there is a contradiction between a Bodhisattva's
developing a determination to leave cyclic existence by viewing it as faulty
and a Bodhisattva's wishing to remain in cyclic existence in order to help
others.  An answer to this is given in Bhavaviveka's Heart of the Middle Way:
...because of being under the influence of love and compassion, one is not
captivated by the idea of retreating into solitary peace and, with an attitude
of seeking to bring about the welfare of other sentient beings, remains in
cyclic existence.  This attitude is really marvelous.  Though you are really
fed up with cyclic existence, still because of a willingness and a
determination to serve others, you voluntarily accept to remain.
  However, as is indicated by the frequently cited example of a lotus that is
produced from mud but not polluted by it, a Bodhisattva stays in cyclic
existence but is not affected by its faults.  It would indeed be hypocritical
to claim from one's mouth that one had taken up the practice of a Bodhisattva
but actually to be happily stuck in cyclic existence with great attachment.

    Sutras, tantras, esoteric instructions, and experiences teach
    The vital point of deathlessness, awakening without meditating:
    How this body of karma fully ripening
    Arises as a naturally pure awareness body.
    Visualize the fully ripening karmic body as the deity's form
    And meditate without fixation on it.
    It is itself inseparable from mind.
    No essence of mind is established,
    So where is something that dies?
    "Death" is just a concept.
    The hosts of concepts are nonexistent phenomena of samsara and nirvana.
      -- Mokchokpa

  According to this and other statements, since one's own mind in essence has
no real existence whatsoever, it was always unborn.  Therefore the great
natural liberation of deathlessness is attained.  As for this body of fully
ripening karma, since it is a conglomeration of inert matter, it is not a
basis on which to attribute the designations of birth or death.  In fact, the
body even arises as a mere appearance of mind.
  When one gains confidence in the realization that the mind is unborn and
undying, then the body appears as the deity's form in mahamudra and one
becomes bound to basic space without erring into the path of deluded
appearance.  By this kind of instruction one discovers the kaya of union in
this lifetime.  Even just hearing it can cause one to get enlightened in the
intermediate state as the sambhogakaya of the victors.  Of the Five Golden
Dharmas, it is said to be like the ripened fruit.  (p.  248)

  Buddhas and Bodhisattvas see clearly that our neglect of others, our self-
preoccupation and our disregard for the connection between actions and their
effects are responsible for all our miseries.  The feeling that it doesn't
matter what we do as long as we can get away with it kills our chances of
liberation and enlightenment.  Our selfishness robs us of worldly and
supramundane good qualities, leaving us naked and empty-handed.  It separates
us from happiness now and in the future and fetters us to suffering.
  Resolve never again to let yourself be dominated by this mean and selfish
way of thinking and do everything in your power to combat it.  Your happiness
begins the moment you recognize self-cherishing as your chief foe.  There are
many good reasons why cherishing others makes sense.  Shantideva says:
      The state of Buddhahood is accomplished
      Equally through living beings and Victorious Ones.
      What kind of behavior then is it to revere
      Victorious Ones but not living beings?
  ...If we truly want to please Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and all those noble
beings in the world whom we admire and whose sole guiding principles are their
affection, love and compassion for others, we can do nothing better than to
cherish living beings.  (p.  100)

How Purification Works

  During Nyungne [fasting] practice, true purification is possible primarily
because of the power of Chenrezig's compassion and blessing, as well as our
faith, devotion, and correct motivation to do the practice.  When such causes
and conditions come together, a result inevitably occurs, and this result is
understood as the interdependently-arising nature of all phenomena.
  For the most part, enlightened and unenlightened phenomena all arise due to
this interdependently-arising nature.  As a spiritual practitioner, the basic
qualities one must bring to the practice are faith, devotion, and a trust in
the power of the practice and Chenrezig.  These qualities stem from our own
pure nature of mind, a purity that is identical to Chenrezig's heart, that is,
unceasing love and compassion.  When these two things are combined together,
our devotion and faith and Chenrezig's love and compassion, one could say
miracles happen; a true purification takes place.
  It has been said that when one is sitting before the mandala of Chenrezig,
one should believe that although Chenrezig is not physically visible to us, in
fact he is really there in front of us.  Just as we would be very careful of
our thoughts and behavior if we were in the presence of a powerful and
clairvoyant enlightened guru, in the same way we must generate vigilance so
that we don't act shamefully in front of this great being.  If we develop such
vigilance and noble habit, then our negativities will automatically decrease.

  Reflect on the basic pattern of our existence.  In order to do more than
just barely survive, we need shelter, food, companions, friends, the esteem of
others, resources, and so on; these things do not come about from ourselves
alone but are all dependent on others.  Suppose one single person were to live
alone in a remote and uninhabited place.  No matter how strong, healthy, or
educated this person were, there would be no possibility of his or her leading
a happy and fulfilling existence....  Can such a person have friends?  Acquire
renown?  Can this person become a hero if he or she wishes to become one?  I
think the answer to all these questions is a definite no, for all these
factors come about only in relation to other fellow humans.
  When you are young, healthy, and strong, you sometimes can get the feeling
that you are totally independent and do not need anyone else.  But this is an
illusion.  Even at that prime age of your life, simply because your are a
human being, you need friends, don't you?  This is especially true when we
become old and need to rely more and more on the help of others: this is the
nature of our lives as human beings.
  In at least one sense, we can say that other people are really the principal
source of all our experiences of joy, happiness, and prosperity, and not only
in terms of our day-to-day dealings with people.  We can see that all the
desirable experiences that we cherish or aspire to attain are dependent upon
cooperation and interaction with others.  It is an obvious fact.
  Similarly, from the point of view of a Buddhist practitioner, many of the
high levels of realization that you gain and the progress that you make on
your spiritual journey are dependent upon cooperation and interaction with
others.  Furthermore, at the stage of complete enlightenment, the
compassionate activities of a buddha can come about spontaneously only in
relation to other beings, for those beings are the recipients and
beneficiaries of those enlightened activities.  (p.5)

  The difficulty with a purely materialistic interpretation of life is that,
in addition to ignoring an entire dimension of the mind, it does not deal
effectively with the problems of this life.  A materialistic mind is an
unstable mind, for its happiness is built on transient, physical
circumstances.  Mental disease is as high among the affluent as it is among
the poor, which is a clear indication of the limitations of the approach.
  Although it is essential to maintain a reasonable material basis on which to
live, the emphasis in one's life should be on cultivating the mental and
spiritual causes of happiness.  The human mind is very powerful and our
worldly needs are not so great that they must demand all of our attention,
especially in light of the fact that materialistic success solves so few of
the many challenges and problems that confront men and women throughout their
lives, and it does nothing for them at death.
  On the other hand, if one cultivates spiritual qualities such as mental
harmony, humility, non-attachment, patience, love, compassion, wisdom and so
forth, then one becomes equipped with a strength and intelligence able to deal
effectively with the problems of this life; and because the wealth one is
amassing is mental rather than material, it will not have to be left behind at
death.  There is no need to enter the after-death state empty-handed.  (31)

  The bardo* of this life does not last forever.  We know that, like a guest
in a hotel, our mind is only temporarily sheltered in this body.  As we face
the challenges of this life and the impending challenges of the bardos to
come, how does engaging in the three-stage process of study, contemplation and
meditation help us?  By applying ourselves to these three, we acquire the
skills to stabilize our mind and we develop actual insight into how our mind
functions.  First we gain an understanding of the nature of mind; then, we
experience that nature; and finally, we arrive at the ultimate benefit, which
is fully realizing that nature.
  When we practice these stages of the path, it is like accumulating the exact
things we will need to take with us on our trip.  When we are ready to pack
our suitcase, we will have what we need without looking further.  We will not
have to go out at the last minute and buy a map or a guidebook.  We will not
have to worry about whether we are forgetting something crucial.
  We have knowledge and experience that has blossomed into realization;
therefore we can handle any situation.  We have confidence in ourselves, in
the teachings, and the guidance of our lineage teachers.  At this point, we
can let go of all our doubt and hesitation.  We can simply relax and be who we
are, wherever we are.  (p.58)

        The thoughts that in this year and month
        I will put right all my tasks and plans
        And then start a perfect dharma practice
        Is in fact the devil which brings all downfalls.

  The lack of death awareness prevents one from undertaking the practice of
dharma.  This is very true: If one is not aware of the eventuality of death,
one will be totally concerned and preoccupied with the affairs of this
lifetime alone, and with actions that are just for the benefit of this
lifetime.  Such ventures may take all one's time and energy, but no matter how
important they appear to be, since they are directly related to this lifetime
alone, their benefits are limited--once one leaves the present body, their
benefit ends.  Even though one might have a best friend, when one has to leave
the body, one cannot take the friend along.
  ...Think that after twenty or thirty years even the Dalai Lama will also be
no more.  While I am alive, there will be people who are, from the depths of
their hearts, prepared to give their lives for my sake, but on the day when I
have to leave, I cannot take even one among them with me.  Neither will I be
able to take any of my possessions, even the body which I have always
preserved and protected.  This also will be left behind.  At that time of my
death, what will benefit is only the positive seeds that are imprinted upon my
consciousness.  No other factors will help at that time.  (p.106)

  At the beginning of the process of deity meditation and mantra repetition
one meditates on emptiness, settling the non-inherent existence of oneself and
the deity through a reasoning such as that of dependent-arising--the fact that
both oneself and the deity arise in dependence on their respective bases of
designation.  One's own final nature and the final nature of the deity are the
same, an emptiness of inherent existence.
  To perform deity yoga one does not just withdraw ordinary appearances and
then appear as a deity but causes the mind realising emptiness itself to
appear as a deity.  Thus, it is essential initially to meditate on emptiness,
cleansing all appearances in emptiness.  One then uses that wisdom
consciousness realising emptiness as the basis of emanation of a divine body.
This must be done at least in imitation of a consciousness actually doing
this, for meditation on a truly existent divine body, instead of helping, will
only increase adherence to inherent existence.  Meditated properly, the
appearance of a divine figure is the sport of the ultimate mind of
enlightenment, first in imitation and later in fact.  (p.39)

  If one could attain the state of perfect buddhahood that is free from all
faults, that sees directly all aspects of the qualities to be cultivated and
faults overcome in the quest for enlightenment, and that is physically adorned
with the marks and signs of perfection, the mere perception of which is
beneficial, then one would be beyond the distinction of feeling attraction or
aversion toward the infinite sentient beings.  One would regard all beings
with an equal compassion, and would have the ability to really benefit them.
Think, "I should make every effort to attain this all-beneficial state."
  In brief, the motivation should be, "For the ultimate benefit of the
sentient beings, who are as infinite as the sky is vast, I must attain the
state of a peerless, perfect, pure buddha." This is the aspirational aspect of
the bodhimind.

My cat Elea added a trick to her repertoire this morning.
I sleep in a bit on the weekend, and both cats protest by
visiting the bed every few minutes until I get up.
Elea, being toothless, is afflicted with a mean case of drool when
she's hungry.  So this morning I got a "drool shower" since she
sat next to my face and shook her head vigorously,
flinging drool everywhere (especially onto my face).
I know this wasn't just a fluke because a few minutes later

  Our fundamental nature--what we term 'the buddha nature', the very nature of
our mind, is inherently present within us as a natural attribute.  This mind
of ours, the subject at hand, has been going on throughout beginningless time,
and so has the more subtle nature of that mind.  On the basis of the
continuity of that subtle nature of our mind rests the capacity we have to
attain enlightenment.  This potential is what we call 'the seed of
buddhahood', 'buddha nature', 'the fundamental nature', or 'tathagatagarbha'.
  We all have this buddha nature, each and every one of us.  For example, this
beautiful statue of Lord Buddha here, in the presence of which we are now
sitting, is a representation that honours someone who attained buddhahood.  He
awakened into that state of enlightenment because his nature was the buddha
nature.  Ours is as well, and just as the Buddha attained enlightenment in the
past, so in the future we can become buddhas too.
  ...In any case, there dwells within us all this potential which allows us to
awaken into buddhahood and attain omniscience.  The empowerment process draws
that potential out, and allows it to express itself more fully.  When an
empowerment is conferred on you, it is the nature of your mind--the buddha
nature--that provides a basis upon which the empowerment can ripen you.
Through the empowerment, you are empowered into the essence of the buddhas of
the five families.  In particular, you are 'ripened' within that particular
family through which it is your personal predisposition to attain buddhahood.

For achieving calm abiding...  your mind must have two qualities:
    -great clarity of both the object and the consciousness itself
    -staying one-pointedly on the object of observation.
  Two factors prevent these from developing--laxity and excitement.  Laxity
prevents the development of clarity, and excitement prevents the stability of
staying with the object.
  That which interferes with the steadiness of the object of observation and
causes it to fluctuate is excitement, which includes any scattering of the
mind to an object other than the object of meditation.  To stop that, withdraw
your mind more strongly inside so that the intensity of the mode of
apprehension of the object begins to lower.  If you need a further technique
to withdraw the mind, it helps to leave the object of meditation temporarily
and think about something that makes you more sober, such as the imminence of
death.  Such reflections can cause your heightened mode of apprehension of the
object, the mind's being too tight, to lower or loosen somewhat, whereby you
are better able to stay on the object of observation.
  It is not sufficient just to have stability; clarity is also needed.  That
which prevents clarity is laxity, which is a case of the mind's becoming too
relaxed, too loose, lacking intensity--the tautness of the mind having become
weak, caused by over-withdrawal inside.  Heaviness of mind and body can lead
to becoming lax, which can lead to a type of lethargy in which, losing the
object of observation, you have as if fallen into darkness; this can lead even
to sleep.  When this begins to occur, it is necessary to raise, to heighten,
this excessive declination of the mind by making it more taut, more tight.  To
accomplish this, it helps to brighten the object of meditation or, if that
does not work, to leave the object of meditation temporarily and think on
something that makes you joyous, such as the wonderful opportunity that a
human lifetime affords for spiritual practice.  If that does not work, you can
even leave off meditating and go to a high place or where there is a vast
view.  Such techniques cause your deflated mind to heighten, to sharpen.
  While holding the object of observation with mindfulness, investigate with
introspection from time to time to see whether the mind has come under the
influence of laxity or excitement and determine the best practice for lowering
or heightening it.  In time, your will develop a sense of the proper level of
tautness of the mind such that you will be able to catch laxity and excitement
just before they arise and prevent their arising.  (p.50)

The position of the body [during meditation] is very important because the
channels within the body will follow the external disposition of the body.
The way the body is placed will set the channels; and the winds, of course,
flow inside the channels, so if they are properly set, the winds will flow
properly.  Mind follows the wind.  To focus the mind properly, the winds must
also be functioning properly.  (p.39)

  The real source of my suffering is self-centeredness: my car, my possession,
my well-being.  Without the self-centeredness, the suffering would not arise.
What would happen instead?  It is important to imagine this fully and to focus
on examples of your own.  Think of some misfortune that makes you want to lash
out, that gives rise to anger or misery.  Then imagine how you might respond
without suffering.  Recognize that we need not experience the misery, let
alone the anger, resentment, and hostility.  The choice is ours.
  Let's continue with an example.  You see that there is a dent in the car.
What needs to be done?  Get the other driver's license number, notify the
police, contact the insurance agency, deal with all the details.  Simply do it
and accept it.  Accept it gladly as a way to strengthen your mind further, to
develop patience and the armor of forbearance.  There is no way to become a
Buddha and remain a vulnerable wimp.
  Patience does not suddenly appear as a bonus after full enlightenment.  Part
of the whole process of awakening is to develop greater forbearance and
equanimity in adversity.  Santideva, in the sixth chapter of his Guide to the
Bodhisattva's Way of Life, eloquently points out that there is no way to
develop patience without encountering adversity, and patience is indispensable
for our own growth on the path to awakening.  (p.66)

  When I was a boy, Ling Rinpochay, who was then my junior tutor, was always
very stern; he never smiled, not even a little.  This bothered me a lot.  By
wondering why he was so humorless, I examined more and more what I was doing
in my own mind.  This helped me develop self-awareness with regard to my
motivation.  By my early twenties when I had matured, Ling Rinpochay
completely changed; he always had a big smile when we were together.
  Effective practice of the morality of individual liberation depends upon
sound, long-term motivation.  For example, one should not become a monk or a
nun to avoid having to work at a worldly job for food and clothing.  Also, it
is not sufficient merely to seek to avoid difficulty in this lifetime.  To be
motivated by such trifling purposes does not help to achieve freedom from
cyclic existence--the ultimate reason to practice the morality of individual
liberation.
  This is confirmed by Buddha's life story.  One day Shakyamuni slipped
outside the palace wall to experience life for himself.  For the first time he
saw a sick person, an old person, and a corpse.  Deeply troubled by the
suffering of sickness, aging, and death, he came to the conclusion that
worldly life is without substance.  Later, inspired by several religious
practitioners, Buddha became captivated by the possibility of a higher, more
meaningful, spiritual life.  At that point he escaped from the palace, leaving
his ordinary life behind to pursue that vision.
  What does this teach us?  Like Buddha we need to begin by becoming concerned
about the suffering of cyclic existence and by turning away from temporary
distractions.  Influenced by this new attitude, we must take up a system of
morality by renouncing cyclic existence and by taking vows of pure behavior
through seeking to avoid the ten nonvirtues.  (p.29)

  Tsong-ka-pa's intention in praising Buddhism is not to insult other
teachers.  Statements of the greatness of Buddhism are made in order to
develop one-pointedness of mind toward practice, for one who is able to
practise Buddhism must generate effort to do so.  It is necessary for him to
have confidence in Buddha's teaching from the round orb of his heart.
  There is a Tibetan saying that one cannot sew with a two-pointed needle or
achieve aims with a two-pointed mind.  Similarly, if a practitioner is
hesitant, he will not put great force into the practice of any one system.
Tsong-ka-pa states that Buddhism is the best in order that persons who would
be helped more through engaging in the Buddhist path than through another
system might not be diverted to another path.  (p.48)

  At the level of conventional truth we all naturally possess both the desire
and the potential to overcome suffering and to attain happiness.  In this
context, we can reflect upon the Buddha's teachings on the Four Noble Truths
and the Two Truths, and on the basis of such reflection we gradually develop
an understanding of how we can gain freedom from suffering and of the
potential we possess within ourselves for accomplishing such a goal.
  We can reflect further that: 'Just like me, all other sentient beings
possess this same desire and potential to be happy and overcome suffering',
and ask ourselves: 'If I continue to be guided by my own self-centredness and,
through my single-pointed concern for my own well-being, continue to ignore
the well-being of others, what will the consequences be?'
  Then we can reflect: 'From beginningless lifetimes I have harboured this
self-cherishing attitude and have grasped onto the notion of an intrinsically
real, enduring self.  I have nurtured these two thoughts of self-cherishing
and self-grasping deep in my heart as if they are twin jewels.  But where has
this way of being led me?  By pursuing the dictates of my self-grasping and
self-centredness, have I actually managed to attain the fulfilment of my self-
interest?  If it were possible, surely by now I should have achieved my goal.
But I know that this is not the case.'
  We should then compare ourselves to enlightened beings such as the Buddha
Shakyamuni who achieved total victory over all defilements and perfected all
qualities of goodness.  We should then ask ourselves: 'How did the Buddha
accomplish this?' Through contemplation we will come to recognise that, at a
certain point in his existence, the Buddha reversed the normal way of thinking
and being.  In the place of self-cherishing he cultivated the thought of
cherishing the well-being of other sentient beings, and in place of self-
grasping he cultivated the wisdom realising the absence of self-existence.  In
this way he attained full awakening.  (p.30)

In the history of the Nyungne tradition, many practitioners have been able to
overcome incurable disease through the practice of Nyungne.  We could say
miracles like this literally do take place, although in the Buddhist
understanding, overcoming great obstacles and disease would be considered
blessings.  A miracle is something else.  It is the enlightened power that is
demonstrated by enlightened masters.  A true miracle in the Buddhist sense
would be like the miracle of Milarepa entering into a little horn while his
student, Rechungpa, sees him in his usual size yet he is inside the horn.  Or
like the miracle of Milarepa sitting on a lake and people seeing that he
hasn't become any larger nor has the lake shrunk in size, yet he is completely
covering it.  These are real, enlightened miracles.(p.13)

  [In listening to teachings one] of the defects is to listen in a way that is
like a container with holes.  This means that even though we are listening to
the teachings, we do not retain their contents.  In this case we lack
mindfulness and memory.  Practice of Dharma means that we should be able to
benefit from what we have heard.  It is not a pastime, like listening to a
story.  The teachings give us guidance on how to live meaningful lives and how
to develop proper attitudes.  So in order to benefit from the teachings, we
must retain them with mindfulness.
  In all kinds of learning processes, listening, reading, etc., we must pay
full attention and should endeavor to remember their contents.  When our
interest is halfhearted, we only remember half the points, and we retain them
for only a short time.  We should reflect and think about whatever we have
heard, over and over again.  In this way, the knowledge will stay in our mind
for a long time.  Another technique for remembering instructions is debate as
it is practiced in the traditional debating schools.  (p.22)

  We are duped by maya.  The whole display of our senses has tricked us into
believing it and thus seduces us into the world of suffering.  And the
illusionist is that old trickster, one's own mind.  But when this illusory
nature is recognized to be just that, one is released from the bondage of the
magic show, at which time it becomes a wonderful spectacle, even a display of
the unimpeded creativity and freedom of mind.  Then maya itself is both the
medium for this realization and the expression of it.
  This conscious and intentional method of relating to all phenomena as
illusion is thus cast in a totally positive light on the spiritual path, a
complete turn-around from the original negative valuation of it as deceit.
Now illusion is seen as illumination and opportunity.  The nature of our
relationship with it is the salient point, rather than its own nature, which
certainly does not exist anyway, in any way.
  Aryadeva says:
      Since everything is an illusory display,
      it is possible to attain enlightenment.
  The transformation of the maya concept from something to escape to something
to engage may be loosely correlated with the shift of emphasis on
understanding emptiness that emerged in the mahayana teachings.  A further
development may be seen in the vajrayana teachings with the esoteric
instruction known as Illusory Body (sgyu lus).  This occurs as one of the Six
Dharmas of Niguma and in other configurations of completion stage practices in
many lineages.  (p.40)

  Afflictions are classed as peripheral mental factors and are not themselves
any of the six main minds [eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mental
consciousnesses].  However, when any of the afflicting mental factors becomes
manifest, a main mind [a mental consciousness] comes under its influence, goes
wherever the affliction leads it, and 'accumulates' a bad action.
  There are a great many different kinds of afflictions, but the chief of them
are desire, hatred, pride, wrong view and so forth.  Of these, desire and
hatred are chief.  Because of an initial attachment to oneself, hatred arises
when something undesirable occurs.  Further, through being attached to oneself
the pride that holds one to be superior arises, and similarly when one has no
knowledge of something, a wrong view that holds the object of this knowledge
to be non-existent arises.
  How do self-attachment and so forth arise in such great force?  Because of
beginningless conditioning, the mind tightly holds to 'I, I' even in dreams,
and through the power of this conception, self-attachment and so forth occur.
This false conception of 'I' arises because of one's lack of knowledge
concerning the mode of existence of things.  The fact that all objects are
empty of inherent existence is obscured and one conceives things to exist
inherently; the strong conception of 'I' derives from this.  Therefore, the
conception that phenomena inherently exist is the afflicting ignorance that is
the ultimate root of all afflictions.  (p.26)

  With regard to awareness of the present moment, our mind is utterly
insubstantial and yet has this characteristic of luminosity (Tib.  salwa).
"Luminosity" here simply means the cognitive capacity, the fact that our mind
can know, experience, feel, and so on.  This awareness always occurs in the
present.  When we are not thinking of the past or thinking of the future, when
we're letting our mind simply rest in the direct experience of the present
moment, then this awareness or lucidity emerges as an unfabricated
intelligence.
  Initially we do this very briefly, for one moment, two moments, and so on,
but as we work with this, it starts to take on a momentum.  However, it's
important not to interfere with the naturalness of this awareness by
appraising what is occurring, which means that we shouldn't think, "Well, this
is happening, that is happening, I'm aware of this, I'm aware of that." Nor
should we judge what's happening by thinking, "Well, this is good, this is
what's supposed to be happening," or, "This is bad, this isn't what's supposed
to be happening."
  On the other hand, we do need to "plant the watchman of mindfulness and
alertness," which means that we maintain some intentional awareness of what is
occurring.  Here, mindfulness means a simple, direct recollection of what
we're trying to do.  In other words, mindfulness is recollecting that we are
trying to rest in a direct experience of the present moment.  Alertness then
is that faculty of mind that becomes aware when we become distracted from this
present experience.  However, this watchfulness or, this watchman, has to be
very relaxed and gentle.  It can't be too heavy-handed, otherwise the whole
thing becomes a conceptual judgement.  The technique of mind is to rest in
this awareness of the present moment with a gentle watchman of mindfulness and
alertness.  (p.36)

The future is here.  It's just not widely distributed yet.  -- William Gibson
~
  Complete spiritual fulfillment requires the ability to act compassionately,
and that involves making practical distinctions.  Therefore, Tsong-kha-pa
insists upon the clarifying power of analysis that is not ultimate, analysis
that operates within the constraints and boundaries of conventional fact and
language so as to illuminate what does and what does not exist, what is and
what is not helpful.
  Not all useful analysis need immediately reduce everything to emptiness.  In
other words, we can learn valuable, practical things by analyzing which car is
good to drive, which action is good to do, which seed is good to plant,
without at each step interrogating the final ontological status of the car,
action, or seed.
  ...A pervasive sense that things are real and solid and exist just as they
appear is woven right into the fabric of the world as we experience it.  While
tables do exist, we have yet to see them just as they are.  Our very
perception of them--while a valid source of information--is at the same time
contaminated with a layer of distortion.  That distortion is the appearance of
the table as something that is able to be there on its own power, something
that exists in and of itself.
  Thus when we begin to see, or even to suspect, that things lack essence and
are not at all as we had supposed, we may feel terrified, as though our world
is coming apart at the seams or evaporating beneath our feet.  We calm those
fears by again remembering that it is not that there is nothing.  There is
dependent arising, just as there has always been.  Analysis threatens nothing
but the false overlay, the distorting superimposition, which has caused us and
others so much misery.  (p.43)

        The play of this divine mind,

          -- The Seventh Dalai Lama, Kelsang Gyatso

  Cultivate a state of mind focused on bliss and emptiness as forcefully as
possible.  The wisdom of bliss and emptiness is compared to space, which is
non-obstructive and expansive.  Because offerings are the manifestation of the
wisdom of bliss and emptiness, these substances are called "offerings of
Samantabhadra (All-Good)."
  Generally speaking, a bodhisattva named Samantabhadra is renowned for his
elaborate offerings to the buddhas and bodhisattvas.  But here the term all-
good (samantabhadra) refers most appropriately to the wisdom of bliss and
emptiness.  It is all-good from the viewpoint of emptiness and also from the
viewpoint of bliss.  This emptiness is the ultimate truth and also the
ultimate virtue.  And the wisdom of great bliss is the clear light wisdom:
With a feeling of joy, imagine that offerings having such a nature pervade
entire space.  (p.64)

  The spiritual path is truly simple.  It is simple because it is not about
acquiring, accumulating, or achieving anything.  It is all about giving up
what we don't need.  It's about giving up what isn't useful instead of
acquiring things with the idea of going somewhere or achieving something.
That was the old game.  That game which we have been playing for a long time
is like a vicious circle.  It has no end.
  Sometimes the spiritual search itself prevents us from seeing the truth that
is always one with us.  We have to know when to stop the search.  There are
people who die while they are searching for the highest truth with
philosophical formulas and esoteric techniques.  For them spiritual practice
becomes another egoic plot which simply maintains and feeds delusions.

  Practice of the morality of individual liberation, whether lay or monastic,
leads to contentment....  Examine your attitudes toward food, clothes, and
shelter.  By reducing expectations you will promote contentment.  The extra
energy which is released should be devoted to meditation and to achieving
cessation of problems, corresponding to the fourth and third noble truths.  In
this way, contentment is the basis, and the resulting action is called "liking
meditation and abandonment."
  We should be contented in material areas, for those are bound by limitation,
but not with regard to the spiritual, which can be extended limitlessly.
Though it is true that a discontented person who owned the whole world might
want to own a tourist center on the moon, that person's life is limited, and
even the amount that can be owned is limited.  It is better right from the
beginning to be contented.
  However, with regard to compassion and altruism there is no limit, and thus
we should not be content with the degree that we have.  We are just the
opposite; in the spiritual field we are content with slight amounts of
practice and progress, but materially we always want more and more.  It should
be the other way around.  Everyone needs to practice this, whether lay or
monastic.  (p.67)

  If we view the world's religions from the widest possible viewpoint and
examine their ultimate goal, we find that all of the major world religions,
whether Christianity or Islam, Hinduism or Buddhism, are dedicated to the
achievement of permanent human happiness.  They are all directed toward that
goal.  All religions emphasize the fact that the true follower must be honest
and gentle, in other words, that a truly religious person must always strive
to be a better human being.  To this end, the different world religions teach
different doctrines which will help transform the person.  In this regard, all
religions are the same, there is no conflict.  This is something we must
emphasize.  We must consider the question of religious diversity from this
viewpoint.  And when we do, we find no conflict.
  ...Different kinds of food have different tastes: one may be very hot, one
may be very sour, and one very sweet.  They are opposite tastes, they
conflict.  But whether a dish is concocted to taste sweet, sour, or hot, it is
nonetheless made in this way so as to taste good.  Some people prefer very
spicy, hot foods with a lot of chili peppers.  Many Indians and Tibetans have
a liking for such dishes.  Others are very fond of bland tasting foods.  It is
a wonderful thing to have variety.  It is an expression of individuality; it

principles and precepts of the practice, then your mind is always going to be
overrun by the five mental afflictions.  These negative afflictions are
desire, hatred, jealousy, pride, and ignorance.  They are the basic obstacles
which impede you from making any true progress on the path.  It is, in fact,
the function of the preliminary training to prepare the field of the mind so
that you are actually able to put to rest the gross delusions and give rise to
your innermost qualities.  This allows you to actualize your true bodhicitta
nature, the mind which cares about others more than self.
  Leaving aside the idea of the so-called spiritual path, or religion, if you
are able to uproot these delusions, the stones and boulders, from the field of
your mind, then you will become an honorable person, respected in the world,
with an easier, flexible attitude toward yourself and others.  If you are
able, through your development of wisdom and skillful means, to unite the
teachings with your life, then true results will be achieved.  (p.96)

~
  What premises or grounds do we have for accepting that mental afflictions
can be ultimately rooted out and eliminated from our mind?  In Buddhist
thought, we have three principal reasons for believing that this can happen.
One is that all deluded states of mind, all afflictive emotions and thoughts,
are essentially distorted in their mode of apprehension, whereas all the
antidotal factors such as love, compassion, insight, and so on not only are
undistorted, but they also have grounding in our varied experience and in
reality.
  Second, all these antidotal forces also have the quality of being
strengthened through practice and training.  Through constant familiarity, one
can enhance their capacity and increase their potential limitlessly.  So the
second premise is that as one enhances the capacity of these antidotal forces
and increases their strength, one is able to correspondingly reduce the
influences and effects of delusory states of mind.
  The third premise is that the essential nature of mind is pure; in other
words, there is the idea that the essential nature of mind is clear light or
Buddha-nature.
  So it is on these three premises that Buddhism accepts that delusions, all
afflictive emotions and thoughts, can be ultimately eliminated through
practice and meditation.  (p.38)

  As we become aware of the working of our mind, we'll find ourselves
grappling with an inner trickster.  Pay attention!  The mind in which anger
arises is also the mind that holds it, hides it, fans it, justifies it, or
suppresses it.  That's why this first step is crucial--before we can
understand, befriend, tame, and transform our anger, we have to recognize it
clearly and acknowledge it frankly.  This is no small task.
  Self-awareness is a precondition for understanding and healing our anger.
If we become aware of the workings of our mind we can discover the means by
which we create our anger and the key to healing it.  If we become aware that
we are harboring irrational beliefs, ideas with false premises, mistaken
assumptions or flawed logic, we can examine them and correct them.  If we
discover that we cherish ideas which are not in harmony with the realities of
life and nature we can learn to relax into existence.  If we find that we
harbor desires, hopes, and expectations which cannot be achieved we have the
option of letting them go.
  ...To develop awareness is to take a journey within--into the heart of our
being.  (p.33)

  A kind heart is the essential cause of happiness.  Being kind to others is
the nicest thing we can do for ourselves.  When we respect others and are
considerate of their needs, opinions and wishes, hostility evaporates.  It
takes two people to fight, and if we refuse to be one of them, there is no
quarrel.
  ...A kind heart is the root of harmony and mutual respect.  It prevents us
from feeling estranged or fearful of others.  It also protects us from
becoming angry, attached, closed-minded, proud or jealous.  When opportunities
arise to help others we won't lack courage or compassion.  If political
leaders had impartial minds and kind hearts, how different our world would be!
  As all problems arise from the self-cherishing attitude, it would be wise
for each of us, as individuals, to exert ourselves to subdue it.  World peace
doesn't come from winning a war, nor can it be legislated.  Peace comes
through each person eliminating his or her own selfishness and developing a
kind heart...we can each do our part beginning today.  The beneficial result
in our own lives will immediately be evident.  (p.76)

  In order to have strong consideration for others' happiness and welfare, it
is necessary to have a special altruistic attitude in which you take upon
yourself the burden of helping others.  In order to generate such an unusual
attitude, it is necessary to have great compassion, caring about the suffering
of others and wanting to do something about it.  In order to have such a
strong force of compassion, first you must have a strong sense of love which,
upon observing suffering sentient beings, wishes that they have happiness--
finding a pleasantness in everyone and wishing happiness for everyone just as
a mother does for her sole sweet child.
  In order to have a sense of closeness and dearness for others, you first
train in acknowledging their kindness through using as a model a person in
this lifetime who was very kind to yourself and then extending this sense of
gratitude to all beings.  Since, in general, in this life your mother was the
closest and offered the most help, the process of meditation begins with
recognizing all other sentient beings as like your mother.  (p.44)

  Most people feel cozy enough in samsara.  They do not really have the
genuine aspiration to go beyond samsara; they just want samsara to be a little
bit better.  It is quite interesting that "samsara" became the name of a
perfume.  And it is like that.  It seduces us into thinking that it is okay:
samsara is not so bad; it smells nice!  The underlying motivation to go beyond
samsara is very rare, even for people who go to Dharma centers.  There are
many people who learn to meditate and so forth, but with the underlying motive
that they hope to make themselves feel better.  And if it ends up making them
feel worse, instead of realizing that this may be a good sign, they think
there is something wrong with Dharma.  We are always looking to make ourselves
comfortable in the prison house.  We might think that if we get the cell wall
painted a pretty shade of pale green, and put in a few pictures, it won't be a
prison any more.
  ...There are two basic reasons we follow a spiritual path and look for
liberation.  One reason is that we want to be free.  Let's take the
traditional example of a burning house: your whole house is on fire, and you
run out from it.  But all your family--your partner, your children, your
parents, even your pet dog--are all still inside.  What are you going to do?
You don't just say, "Well, I'm out.  So too bad.  Do your best to get out,
too." Naturally this leads to the second basic reason for following a
spiritual path: we will try to pull them out as well.  (p.71)

    "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form."

  We are empty, or rather the matter of which we are composed is empty.  But I
must emphasize that emptiness does not mean nothingness.  Some commentators
have been mistaken when they have accused Buddhism of being nihilistic.  We
believe that the world in which we live is part of a flux, a stream of events.
This does not mean it is nothing.  Everything depends on everything else.
Nothing exists on its own.  On account of all the influences that come to bear
upon them, things appear, exist, and disappear, and then reappear again.  But
they never exist independently.  Form is therefore empty, by which we mean it
is not separate and independent.  Form depends on a multitude of different
factors.  And emptiness is form because all forms emerge from emptiness, from
this absence of independent existence.  Emptiness exists only to give rise to
form.  (p.341)

     Peace: The Essential Life and Teachings".

  When we understand the empty nature of our own mind, then the consequences
of merit and sin will not be realized.  In the state of emptiness, there
exists no objective merit or sin.
  ...The nature of the mind is like a mirror; merits and sins are like the
reflections in this mirror; and reflections in no way affect or modify the
nature of the mirror.  When we are in a state of contemplation, we are living
in the condition of the mirror.  At the time when all phenomena are exhausted
and pass into the nature of reality, then our virtuous and vicious deeds will
cause no benefit or harm to us.  There is no basis for effect--all
limitations, all frames of reference, all solid ground having been eliminated.
But if we do not understand the nature of the mind and intrinsic awareness
through direct personal experience, it will be a very dangerous situation for
us.
  Indeed, it is not sufficient merely to understand these teachings
intellectually; one must first practice and attain realization from this
practice.  Otherwise the virtuous and the vicious acts we commit in this life
will create and accumulate karma, leading us again inevitably into
transmigration.  From the present time until we realize the ultimate
exhausting of all phenomena into the nature of reality, our behavior must be
refined; it must be heedful and scrupulous.  Otherwise our view is only so
much empty intellectual talk.  (p.66)

  The attainment of shamata is a serenely stilled state of mind, settled on
mind itself.  Although the attainment of such a meditational state focused on
mind is the foundation for developing the highest attainments and is, of
course, very excellent, by itself it is insufficient for reaching those goals.
  When we achieve a mind focused on mind with the perfect placement of
absorbed concentration, free from all faults of dullness or flightiness, we
increasingly experience an element of bliss accompanying our meditation.  When
we experience serene joy, on both a physical and mental level, brought on by
the force of total absorption of mind on mind, we achieve a meditational state
that fulfills the definition of shamata.
  Our ordinary mind is like raw iron ore that needs to be made into a steel
sword.  Progressing through the stages for attaining shamata is like forging
the iron into steel.  All the materials are there at our disposal.  But since
the mind wanders after external objects, then although it is the material for
attaining shamata, it cannot yet be used as this product.  We have to forge
our mind through a meditational process.  It is like putting the iron ore into
fire.
  To fashion the steel into a sword, or in this analogy to fashion the mind
into an instrument that understands voidness, our serenely stilled and settled
mind needs to come to decisive realization of voidness as its object.  Without
such a weapon of mind, we have no opponent with which to destroy the
disturbing emotions and attitudes.  (p.142)

  The Yolmo Valley has many different aspects that are beneficial to
practitioners.  Ian Baker writes:
  Chatral Rinpoche said that specific [places] in Yolmo are conducive to
particular kinds of practice.  Places with waterfalls inspire reflection on
impermanence.  Places with steep cliffs where the rocks are dark and jagged
are good for meditating on wrathful deities.  Places with rolling hills and
flowering meadows support meditation on peaceful deities....
  Chatral Rinpoche clarified that the beyul [hidden lands] that Padmasambhava
established in Tibet are not literal arcadias, but paradises for Buddhist
practice, with multiple dimensions corresponding to increasingly subtle levels
of perception.  Beyond Yolmo's visible terrain of mountains, streams, and
forests, he said, lies an inner level, corresponding to the flow of intangible
energies in the physical body.  Deeper still, the subtle elements animating
the environment merge with the elements present within the practitioner--the
secret level.
  Finally, at the beyul's innermost level--yangsang--lies a paradisiacal, or
unitary dimension revealed through an auspicious conjunction of person, place,
and time....  Chatral Rinpoche contended that yangsang is not merely a
metaphor for the enlightened state, but an ever-present, if hidden, reality.

  Distinguishing between constructive and destructive emotions is right there
to be observed in the moment when a destructive emotion arises--the calmness,
the tranquillity, the balance of the mind are immediately disrupted.  Other
emotions do not destroy equilibrium or the sense of well-being as soon as they
arise, but in fact enhance it--so they would be called constructive.
  Also there are emotions that are aroused by intelligence.  For example,
compassion can be aroused by pondering people who are suffering.  When the
compassion is actually experienced, it is true that the mind is somewhat
disturbed, but that is more on the surface.  Deep down there is a sense of
confidence, and so on a deeper level there is no disturbance.  A consequence
of such compassion, aroused by intelligent reflection, is that the mind
becomes calm.
  The consequences of anger--especially its long-term effects--are that the
mind is disturbed.  Typically, when compassion moves from simply being a
mental state to behavior, it tends to manifest in ways that are of service to
others, whereas when anger goes to the point of enactment it generally, of
course, becomes destructive.  Even if it doesn't manifest as violence, if you
have the capacity to help, you would refrain from helping.  That too would be
a kind of destructive emotion.  (p.158)

I love smiles.  That is a fact.  How to develop smiles?  There are a variety
of smiles.  Some smiles are sarcastic.  Some smiles are artificial-diplomatic
smiles.  These smiles do not produce satisfaction, but rather fear or
suspicion.  But a genuine smile gives us hope, freshness.  If we want a
genuine smile, then first we must produce the basis for a smile to come.

  Suffering is something very concrete, which everyone knows and wants to
avoid if possible, and the Buddha therefore began his teaching by talking
about it in his famous formulation of the Four Noble Truths.
  The first truth draws our attention to the fact that we suffer, pointing out
the existence of the basic dissatisfaction inherent in our condition; the
second truth explains the cause of dissatisfaction, which is the dualistic
state and the unquenchable thirst (or desire) inherent in it: the subject
reifies its objects and tries to grasp them by any means, and this thirst (or
desire) in turn affirms and sustains the illusory existence of the subject as
an entity separate from the integrated wholeness of the universe.
  The third truth teaches that suffering will cease if dualism is overcome and
reintegration achieved, so that we no longer feel separate from the plenitude
of the universe.  Finally, the fourth truth explains that there is a Path that
leads to the cessation of suffering, which is the one described by the rest of
the Buddhist teachings.
  All the various traditions are agreed that this basic problem of suffering
exists, but they have different methods of dealing with it to bring the
individual back to the experience of primordial unity.  (p.47)

  To disciples of increasing purity, ability, and rarity the Buddha gave more
private guidance in the subtle mysteries.  It appears that such teachings are
included in the Mahayana sutras.  There is no certainty, however, that all of
the tantras were taught while the historical Buddha was alive.  To an
extremely small number of pure disciples the Buddha could appear today.  They
could encounter Vajradhara, the King of the Tantras, and he could reveal
tantras and quintessential guidance to them.
  This is possible even though more than twenty-five hundred years have gone
by since the historical Buddha passed away.  There is no possibility, after
the Buddha's death, of additions being made to his public discourses.  But I
think that teachings to disciples of pure action do not necessarily have to be
given during the historical Buddha's lifetime.  (pg.44)

    Since the five perfections without wisdom
    Cannot bring perfect enlightenment,
    Along with skillful means cultivate the wisdom
    Which does not conceive the three spheres [as real]
    This is the practice of Bodhisattvas.
      -- Gyelsay Togmay Sangpo

  Practice of the five perfections without the understanding of reality
remains contaminated, and though it may yield boundless happiness, it doesn't
lead to omniscience.  Love and compassion without the understanding of reality
cannot help us to escape from worldly existence.
  On the other hand, we may easily remain trapped in a state of personal peace
if we have understood reality but lack enough love and compassion.  It is
therefore the practice of Bodhisattvas to combine the two--skillful means and
wisdom.  Which of us can say we don't want to possess knowledge, kindness and
pure conduct?  Our text is a manual of instruction on how to gain these
qualities and become a fully developed human being.  (p.70)

    "The Buddhas have already achieved all their own goals, but remain in the
cycle of existence for as long as there are sentient beings.  This is because
they possess great compassion.  They also do not enter the immensely blissful
abode of nirvana like the Hearers.  Considering the interests of sentient
beings first, they abandon the peaceful abode of nirvana as if it were a
burning iron house.  Therefore, great compassion alone is the unavoidable
cause of the non-abiding nirvana of the Buddha."
    -- Kamalashila

  Compassion's importance cannot be overemphasized.  Chandrakirti paid rich
tribute to compassion, saying that it was essential in the initial,
intermediate, and final stages of the path to enlightenment.
  Initially, the awakening mind of bodhichitta is generated with compassion as
the root, or basis.  Practice of the six perfections and so forth is essential
if a Bodhisattva is to attain the final goal.
  In the intermediate stage, compassion is equally relevant.  Even after
enlightenment, it is compassion that induces the Buddhas not to abide in the
blissful state of complacent nirvana.  It is the motivating force enabling the
Buddhas to enter non-abiding nirvana and actualize the Truth Body, which
represents fulfillment of your own purpose, and the Form Body, which
represents fulfillment of the needs of others.  Thus, by the power of
compassion, Buddhas serve the interests of sentient beings without
interruption for as long as space exists.  This shows that the awakening mind
of bodhichitta remains crucial even after achieving the final destination.

  [During sleep and waking states] there are physiological processes that
correspond to different mental states, and these are associated with
subjectively experienced energies in the body.
  In the waking state, these energies tend to be drawn into a locus in the
center of the head, at the level of the forehead.  In the dreaming stage,
these energies will be even more drawn to a point in the throat.  In the deep
sleep state, these energies are more drawn into the heart.  The location is
not the physical heart, the organ, but the heart center which is right in the
center of the chest.
  Certain events are experienced in meditation that seem to corroborate this
theory.  For example, in meditation, it is possible to bring your awareness
into the heart cakra, and sometimes when this happens, the person will faint.
On other occasions, the meditative awareness, finely concentrated, may be
brought into the area of the navel.  And at this juncture, it has been found
experientially that heat is produced by such concentration.  If you look at
the anatomy of the body, you don't find these cakra points.  (p.106)

  When you meditate with concentration, there are three particular experiences
that arise: bliss, clarity, and nonthought.
  The experience of meditative bliss is greater than ordinary worldly
happiness.  Sometimes when you are meditating, a feeling of blissfulness
suddenly arises from the subtle state of your mind and pervades your entire
body.  This bliss is healthy and brings out your inner qualities.  Some people
use drugs to induce blissfulness and visions, but drugs are external supports
that cannot bring lasting happiness.  The bliss experienced in meditation can
last for many days, according to your ability to meditate.  When you
experience this kind of bliss, on the outside you might look very poor, but
inside you remain very joyful.
  The second main experience in meditation is clarity.  Sometimes while
meditating you can suddenly feel that your mind is very clear and bright.
Even if you are meditating in the dark, you do not feel heavy or tired.
Sometimes your body feels very light and your mind is very clear, and many
kinds of reflections appear.  Clarity brings great wisdom and the ability to
read other people's minds, as well as to see your own past and future lives.
  The third main experience is nonthought, or a state of equanimity without
distractions.  Beginners can also experience this.  Nonthought is more settled
than the experiences of bliss and clarity.  If you have thoughts, they
suddenly dissolve and you can remain continuously in meditation.  As your
ability to meditate develops, your mind becomes more and more settled, so that
you can meditate for one hour or one week or one month without being
distracted by thoughts.  You simply remain in the natural state for as long as
you want.
  Bliss, clarity, and nonthought are the main qualities of concentration.
However, it is important not to be attached to them or concerned about whether
they arise or not; one should simply continue to practice.  (p.29)

  The Buddha's teachings can be divided into two main categories: the
scriptures and realization.  A verse states:

      The teachings of the Teacher have two aspects:
      Scripture and realization presented as they truly are.
      There is nothing else to do but
      Sustain them, speak of them, and practice them.

  When we practice listening, reflecting, and meditating, the teachings will
free us from the heavy darkness of suffering.  They are like a never-setting
sun whose luminous rays reach to the farthest corners of this world.  Among
the eighty-four thousand teachings of the Buddha are those found in Tibet that
maintain the unity of the sutra and mantra traditions.  These teachings are
like a tree trunk with numerous branches: a variety of lamas hold lineages
within diverse traditions.
  ...In showing how to cut through the delusion of duality, these teachings
open up to every living being the possibility of attaining true mastery over
the immense and profound gates to the eighty-four thousand teachings.  They
are precious because they make nonconceptual wisdom manifest and bring forth
the amrita of all-pervading emptiness.  Like placing a perfect fruit in the
palm of our hand, these teachings bring about two kinds of wisdom: the wisdom
that sees the multitude of all phenomena distinctly and the wisdom that sees
clearly into their nature.
  Relying on an appropriate path allows the fruition of practice to manifest.
This result is possible because buddha nature is found in the mindstream of
all living beings.  (p.160)

of view of mere seeming appearances, while the nature of both--luminosity free

the definitive meaning, mere appearances and their nature cannot be separated,

  In the Mahayana 'cause and effect' refer to totally supreme emptiness and
supreme immutable bliss.  The Brief Explication of Initiations (Shekhoddesha)

      That bearing immutable compassion is the effect.
      Emptiness and compassion indivisible
      Are called the mind of enlightenment.

  The indivisibility of these two is a Cause Vehicle in the sense of being the
means by which one progresses, and it is an Effect Vehicle in the sense of
being that to which one is progressing.  Such a Vajra Vehicle has reference to
Highest Yoga Tantra and cannot occur in the lower tantras.  For the supreme
immutable bliss can only arise when one has attained the branch of meditative
stabilisation (in the system of the Kalachakra) and thus the branches of
mindfulness and those below must be the means of achieving it.  The three
lower tantras do not have all the factors that are included in these causal
branches.  (p.107)

On Practice Space

  I encourage you to conduct your own research on the results of practicing in
various environments.  Tibetan yogis are especially attracted to places with
an enormous amount of open space and distant vistas.  I have greatly enjoyed
meditating in the high desert of the eastern Sierra Nevada range, where the
views extend to peaks sixty miles away.  The ability to direct the attention
to such distant points gives a very expansive feeling to the intervening
space.
  In such a spacious environment, allow your awareness to come out, with your
eyes open and your gaze resting vacantly in the space in front of you.  The
experience in a vast space is very different from that in a tiny room.  Gazing
up at a clear night sky studded with stars is a wonderful way to experience
the sheer enormity of space.
  It is important to distinguish between the contents of a space and the space
itself.  Colors and shapes constitute the contents of visual space.  These are
aspects or representations of ordinary phenomena in the visual field.
Attending to the space of the mind means attending to that space from which
all such contents emerge, in which they are present, and into which they
dissolve; it is the space that lingers in between discrete events.  (p.220)

  "Through analytical meditation, you come to a point of clarity and decisive
insight, and at this point it is beneficial to abide in that revelation.  Your
insight will grow gradually like a sprout.  Simply be present and settle your
mind in the absolute nature of reality.  Remain in a state of meditative
equipoise, and do not think of this as a waste of your time.  If you think you
should rather be actively engaged in such practices as circumambulations or
the stage of generation, it is the time for you to be simply present in
meditative equipoise.  But do not just sit and space out."

  In some scholarly discursive meditations in the sutra tradition, one
continually seeks out the mind, and there is a tradition in which
investigation is needed.  Here, in the tradition of Mahamudra and Atiyoga, it
is enough to seek and investigate during this phase of Dharma practice, but
afterwards it is not necessary to continue the search.  In the Katok
tradition, the investigation of the mind is said to takes months, for one
examines for three days each of the points of the mind's color and shape as
well as the exterior and the interior of the body.  Our tradition does not
take so long, so it is important for you to seek out the mind without even a
moment's distraction.  (p.100)

time.  Then this great spreading tree of samsara and nirvana, of duality, of
worldliness, of conditioned being, does not need to be chopped down: it is
already as if dead.  We can relax; done is what had to be done, as the Buddha
sang.
  This is the whole point of the Dharma, of spiritual awakening, of
Buddhahood; this is its ultimate evolution or unfolding.  If we aspire to
experience such an awakening, there is nothing else to do except recognize the
true nature of our primordial awareness, our own essential being, our own
birthright, which is within.  This is the intrinsic nature of our own heart-
mind, also known as bodhicitta or bodhi-mind.  It is our own being, our own
nature, this renowned buddha-nature.  It is not a Buddha anywhere else.  (p.103)

  A common [Tibetan Buddhist] motif is the "Wheel of Life," symbolizing the
workings of cyclic existence.  This is frequently found at the doorway to a
main assembly hall and serves to remind the inhabitants of the dangers of
mundane existence.  This striking image has a large central circle divided
into two halves.  The top half has three sections, representing the three
"happy transmigrations"--humans, demi-gods, and gods.  The lower half also has
three sections, indicative of the three bad transmigrations--animals, hungry
ghosts, and hell beings.  A pigeon symbolizes the mental affliction of desire,
a snake represents hatred, and a pig--symbol of ignorance--holds the tails of
the first two in its mouth.  These three afflictions are the primary factors
that bind people to cyclic existence, causing them to transmigrate helplessly
from birth to birth.
  The theme of cause and effect is further illustrated by twelve sections
around the rim of the wheel, symbolizing the twelve links of dependent arising
(a summary of the process of transmigration).  The whole wheel is held in the
jaws of the Lord of Death, indicating that death is inevitable for those who
are caught up in this cycle.  Outside of the wheel are buddhas and
bodhisattvas, often shown teaching the dharma, which provides an avenue of
escape for those who are perceptive enough to recognize this and follow their
instructions.  (p.239)

Is Anger Beneficial?

  We generally consider something beneficial if it promotes happiness.  But
when we ask ourselves, "Am I happy when I'm angry?" the answer is undoubtedly
no.  We may feel a surge of physical energy due to physiological reasons, but
emotionally we feel miserable.  Thus, from our own experience, we can see that
anger does not promote happiness.
  In addition, we don't communicate well when we're angry.  We may speak
loudly as if the other person were hard of hearing or repeat what we say as if
he had a bad memory, but this is not communication.  Good communication
involves expressing ourselves in a way that the other person understands.  It
is not simply dumping our feelings on the other.  Good communication also
includes expressing our feelings and thoughts with words, gestures, and
examples that make sense to the other person.  Under the sway of anger,
however, we neither express ourselves as calmly nor think as clearly as usual.
  Under the influence of anger, we also say and do things that we later
regret.  Years of trust built with great effort can be quickly damaged by a
few moments of uncontrolled anger....  If we could tame our anger, such
painful consequences could be avoided.(p.23)

  Why should we want to help our enemies or to give them happiness?  Here are
various useful ideas to consider.  One approach is to think that the harm they
have done us is, in fact, the result of our own past negative actions through
which we have set ourselves up as a target for their harm.  We could also
consider how those who harm us are totally driven by their disturbing
emotions.
  If someone in our family, someone we love dearly, becomes insane and tries
to harm us, we wouldn't think of taking revenge but would try to help them
regain a normal state of mind.  Living beings, our mothers, are crazed by
their disturbing emotions.  Those who harm us are in particular need of our
love and compassion.  (p.52)

  On top of the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, we encounter
the pains of facing the unpleasant, separating from the pleasant, and not
finding what we want.  The basic problem lies with the type of mind and body
that we have.  Our mind-body complex serves as a basis for present sufferings
in the form of aging, sickness, and death, and promotes future suffering
through our usual responses to painful situations.
  By reflecting on birth and on the nature of mind and body, you will be moved
from the depths of your heart to seek relief, thinking, "If I could only be
free from a life driven by afflictive emotions and karma!" Without such
reflection on pain, your knowledge of your own condition will be limited,
which itself will put a limit on your compassion.  As Tsonghkapa says:
  "If you do not cultivate a genuine sense of disenchantment with cyclic
existence--whose nature is a mind-body complex under the sway of afflictive
emotions and karma--you will have no chance to develop a genuine attitude
intent on liberation, and there will be no way to develop great compassion for
beings wandering in cyclic existence.  Therefore, it is crucial to reflect on
your situation." (p.151)

  When I was a young boy, Tantra was just a matter of blind faith.  At age
twenty-four I lost my own country, and then after coming to India started
really reading Tsongkhapa's explanations on emptiness.  Then, after moving to
Dharamsala, I put more effort into the study and practice of the stages of the
path, emptiness, and Tantra.  So it was only in my late twenties after gaining
some experience of emptiness that deity yoga made sense.
  One time in the main temple in Dharamsala I was performing the ritual of
imagining myself as a deity of Highest Yoga Tantra, called Guhyasamaja.  My
mind continuously remained on the recitation of the ritual text, and when the
words "I myself" came, I completely forgot about my usual self in relation to
my combination of mind and body: Instead, I had a very clear sense of "I" in
relation to the new, pure combination of mind and body of Guhyasamaja that I
was imagining.  Since this is the type of self-identification that is at the
heart of Tantric yoga, the experience confirmed for me that with enough time I
could definitely achieve the extraordinary, deep states mentioned in the
scriptures.  (p.188)

  In Buddhism, one speaks of three different levels of understanding, which
are sequential--an understanding arrived at through learning and studying, an
understanding developed as a result of deep reflection and contemplation, and
an understanding acquired through meditative experience.
  There is a definite order in the sequence of this three.  So on the basis of
study and learning--which is the first level--we deepen our understanding of a
given topic by constantly reflecting upon it until we arrive at a point where
we gain a high degree of certainty or conviction that is firmly grounded in
reason.  At this point, even if others were to contradict our understanding
and the premises upon which it is based we would not be swayed, because our
conviction in the truth has arisen through the power of our own critical
reflection.  This is the second level of understanding which, however, is
still at the level of the intellect.
  If we pursue this understanding further and deepen it through constant
contemplation and familiarity with the truth, we reach a point where we feel
the impact at the emotional level.  In other words, our conviction is no
longer at the level of mere intellect.  This is the third level of
understanding, which is experiential, and this is referred to in the Buddhist
texts as an understanding derived through meditative experience....  You will
need to deepen your understanding still further by engaging in regular
meditation so that you can progress to the third level of understanding.

  Shortly after attaining enlightenment under the bodhi tree, the Buddha gave
a sermon in Varanasi sharing the fruits of his realization.  This sermon is
referred to as the "first turning of the wheel of Dharma." The word Dharma
here refers to the Buddha's teachings themselves.  It was this sermon in which
the Buddha developed what would become the framework for the entirety of his
teachings: the four noble truths.
  These four truths are the truth of suffering, the truth of its origin, the
truth of the possibility of its cessation, and the truth of the path that
leads to that cessation.  In essence, the four noble truths say that we all
naturally desire happiness and do not wish to suffer--and that the suffering
we wish to avoid comes about as a result of a chain of causes and conditions
begun even before our birth.  If we are to pursue our aspiration to gain
freedom from suffering, we need to clearly understand the causes and
conditions that give rise to suffering and strive to eliminate them.
Additionally, we must clearly understand the causes and conditions that give
rise to happiness as well, and actively practice them.  This is the essence of
the four noble truths.

  In Dzogchen, while thoughts are active, rigpa permeates them all, so that
even at the very moment when powerful thoughts like attachment and aversion
are arising, there remains a pervasive quality of clear light rigpa.
Dodrupchen says, "in Dzogchen, since the clear light's natural way of being is
like the sun and its rays, inseparable, if you are able, through this, to
bring out the radiance of genuine mind, you will be able to maintain the
experience of clear light in meditation, without it fluctuating, or coming and
going."
  Longchen Rabjam speaks of self-arising wisdom, which is in fact rigpa:
"Self-arising wisdom is rigpa that is empty, clear and free from all
elaboration, like an immaculate sphere of crystal.  Its very being is such
that it never explores objects of the senses."
  This "self-arising wisdom" is rigpa, which in essence is primordially pure.
Longchenpa describes it as "empty and clear".  To call it empty is to refer to
its essence, primordially pure.  To call it clear is to speak of its nature,
spontaneously present.  As such, it is "free from all elaboration", and free
from the elaborations of adventitious phenomena.  So it is like a flawless
crystal sphere, and truly "its very being is such that it never explores
objects of the senses".  (p.180-5)

  There is an Indian saying: if you are struck by a poisonous arrow, it is
important first to pull it out, there is no time to ask who shot it, what sort
of poison it is and so on.  First handle the immediate problem, and later we
can investigate.  Similarly, when we encounter human suffering, it is
important to respond with compassion rather than question the politics of
those we help.  Instead of asking whether their country is enemy or friend, we
must think, "These are human beings, they are suffering, and they have a right
to happiness equal to our own."
  Our attitude towards suffering is very important because it can affect how
we cope with it when it arises.  Our usual attitude consists of an intense
aversion and intolerance of our own pain and suffering.  However, if we can
transform our attitude, adopt an attitude that allows us greater tolerance of
it, this can do much to help counteract feelings of mental unhappiness,
dissatisfaction and discontent.  (p.92)

  If you are totally concerned and preoccupied with the affairs of this
lifetime, there is a great danger of causing your own downfall.  If by such
concern you were able to achieve the desired happiness, that is okay, but this
is not the case.
  We all let ourselves be caught in this web of preoccupation with the
activities and confusion of this lifetime.  Having too much worldly
involvement ends in confusion.  We spend our whole lives thinking that this
might be better than that, I should do this, or perhaps something else is
better and I should do that.  If you reflect upon the underlying
dissatisfaction, then you will be able to find that, well, after all, whatever
they might be, the affairs of this lifetime are not that important, because
they yield a limited benefit.  This does not mean that you should not work for
your own livelihood, but it does indicate that you should not be preoccupied
with that alone.  (p.107)

  Do you understand who the enemy is?  You do not need to beat anyone up, and
you do not need a weapon to kill your enemy.  You do not need money to buy a
weapon.  It is all very easy.
  How is liberation accomplished?  The offering of liberation is accomplished
by abandoning the dualistic mind of discursive thoughts.  The sharp weapon of
primordial wisdom, which completely annihilates the dualistic mind, is the
means for achieving this separation.  This "weapon" has been part of your
continuum for a long time now.  With this weapon you can completely devastate
the dualistic mind, leaving not even a trace behind, thus liberating the mind
into the sphere of unborn truth.  The enemy will never return.  This is called
great liberation.
  I must emphasize that primordial wisdom is not something you can buy, get
from your best friend or have handed to you by a buddha in heaven.  It is not
something that someone else has but you do not.  Abandon such concepts.
Primordial wisdom does not come from an external source.  It is simply your
true nature.  It is something that you and everyone else have as the very
essence of your mind.
  You should know what your qualities and capabilities are.  (p.79)

  With regard to ordinary study, except for the fact that there is a limit to
our lifetime, it is not that you arrive at a point where there is no more room
in your brain.  No matter how much you study, even if you study a hundred
thousand million words, the mind can still retain them.  This indicates that
the basis of these qualities, consciousness, is stable and continuous.
  The other day, I made a joke to someone who was asking about the brain.  I
said that if, like a computer, you needed a cell for each moment of memory,
then as you become more and more educated, your head would have to get bigger
and bigger!
  Because of these reasons--that compassion, wisdom, and so forth are
qualities that depend on the mind, and the mind is stable and continuous--they
can be developed to a limitless degree.
  It is from this point of view that it is said that the conception of
inherent existence can be extinguished.  When one removes the conception of
inherent existence, one thereby also ceases the afflictive emotions generated
in dependence upon that ignorance.  Also, since the ignorance that drives
contaminated actions has ceased, this class of actions ceases.  Once the
motivator of the action and the actions cease, the results of those actions
will cease.  That is how the third noble truth--true cessation--comes to be.

  "Accumulating merit" can be approached from a psychological perspective that
lends itself to experiential verification or from a spiritual dimension that
requires some faith.  "Merit" can be understood as "spiritual power" that
manifests in day-to-day experience.  When merit, or spiritual power, is
strong, there is little resistance to practicing Dharma and practice itself is
empowered.
  Tibetans explain that people who make rapid progress in Dharma, gaining one
insight after another, enter practice already having a lot of merit.  By the
same theory, it is possible to strive diligently and make little progress.
Tibetans explain this problem as being due to too little merit.  Merit is the
fuel that empowers spiritual practice.
  How do you accumulate merit?  Engaging in virtue of any sort, with your
mind, your speech, or your body results in merit.  Just as merit can be
accumulated, it can also be dissipated by doing harm.  In general, mental
afflictions dissipate merit.  The mental affliction that is like a black hole
sucking up merit, worse than all the others, is anger.  Attachment or sensual
craving can get you in a lot of trouble, but it doesn't have the debilitating
impact upon spiritual practice that anger does.  Remember the warrior
metaphor--standing at the gateway of the mind, vigilant, spear ready.  The
spear is for mental afflictions, especially anger.  Nip anger in the bud.  (p.208)

  It is necessary to alternate stabilising meditation and analytical
meditation... by merely cultivating non-conceptuality and non-analysis it is
impossible to enter into the yoga of signlessness.
  Even after emptiness has been realised, powerful and repeated analysis is
needed.  Merely to set one's mind on the meaning of emptiness is the mode of
cultivating calm abiding observing emptiness; in order to cultivate special
insight it is necessary to analyse again and again.  These two modes of
meditation--stabilising and analytical--are alternated until analysis itself
induces even greater stablisation, at which point stabilisation and wisdom are
of equal strength, this being a union of calm abiding and special insight.
  In Performance as well as in Action Tantra the meditative stabilisation
which is a union of calm abiding and special insight is used to gain feats for
the sake of aiding sentient beings and accumulating merit quickly.  (p.42)

Seeking a Place of Refuge.

  A spiritual aspirant requires a model, something he or she can look up to as
an ideal and thus find guidance and inspiration.  In Buddhism this is the
Triple Gem, or the Three Jewels of Refuge: the Buddhas, Dharma and Sangha.
  When we think of the fully enlightened Buddhas--the beings who have purified
their minds of all stains and obscurations and who have expanded their wisdom
to the limits of existence--we feel very attracted and awed; but somehow there
always seems to be a great distance between the Buddhas and us.  Therefore,
there is the refuge of Sangha, the community of spiritual aspirants, the
assembly of practitioners dwelling in the various stages of practice and
attainment.
  These beings provide us with a perspective on the path.  We have to look up
to the Sangha, but not as far as to the Buddhas.  The Sangha make us think,
"This person is not that far ahead of me.  If I just make a bit more
effort...." They give us confidence for spiritual practice.  Sometimes they
make us feel like we can even race them to enlightenment.  These are the
Sangha of spiritual friends.
  Thoughts of the Buddhas make us numb with admiration; thoughts of the Sangha
cause us to jump to it and to apply ourselves with zeal to the spiritual path.
This path and the methods for traversing it are the third Jewel of Refuge, the
Dharma.  This is the collection of teachings to be practiced and the
realizations to be attained.  (p.97)

  Suppose there is this religious group building thousands of childcare
facilities and hospices....  Although these religious workers are doing a lot
of caring work, there is no wish to enlighten sentient beings.  Their aim is
just to provide food and education.  At the same time, imagine there is one
hermit living somewhere in the mountains of the Himalayas who is doing none of
this.  In fact, within close range of him, there are a lot of babies dying,
yet outwardly he is doing nothing about it.  Inwardly, however, he is actually
meditating, "May all sentient beings be enlightened!" and he continues to do
this every day.  Purely because of the enlightenment aspect, this person is
worthier of homage than the first group.  Why?  Because it is so difficult to
truly and genuinely wish for the enlightenment of others.  It is much easier
to give people food and educate them.
  Most of us don't really appreciate this fact.  We have never before
genuinely wished for someone else to achieve enlightenment.  Likewise, if
someone were to come over and say to us: "Here you go, you have a ticket for
enlightenment.  There is only one ticket." I don't think we would even think
about giving it to someone else!  We'd grab it and go for it.  Enlightenment
is such a valuable thing.
  Actually, enlightenment is much too large a subject, so let's not take that
as an example.  Instead, let's say someone comes along with a potion that
promises you clairvoyance or omniscience.  We would drink it ourselves, not
even sharing half of it with others!
  Just think how often we are jealous when someone is a better practitioner.
How often do we get jealous when someone receives a better or a higher
teaching than we do?  If you have genuine bodhichitta, you should be happy,
shouldn't you?  After all, isn't that what you wished for?  Their getting
enlightenment means your wish is at last coming true.  Their receiving higher
teachings, or becoming better practitioners, means that your aspiration is
finally being fulfilled!  But we don't feel this way, instead we feel jealous
or envious.  Some of us may be so-so Dharma practitioners, so we don't really
feel jealous or envious, but we still feel left behind.  Who cares?  If you
are a genuine bodhisattva, you shouldn't care about these things.  (p.123)

  It is very difficult to help somebody overcome his or her problems when the
problems are unstructured, when in a certain way this person does not have any
problems, though deep inside all the problems are there.  It is very difficult
for a human being whose problem is confused, whose ego is ill-defined and
without foundation, to really purify, clarify, and develop anything.
  The same principle applies to praying.  As long as we have our self, our
ego, we pray to the Buddha: "Please bless me so that my prayers for the
benefit of all sentient beings be fulfilled." Otherwise our prayer does not
follow any line or direction.  It would be like going to a big five-star hotel
with five hundred rooms and not knowing your room number, or taking an
elevator without knowing which floor to go to--this would be a big problem.
  This is the reason for calling upon the great compassion of the Buddha and
asking him to consider our prayers.  The reason is not that the Buddha only
listens to someone who prays to him; rather, without praying to the Buddha we
are not developed enough to have the condition necessary to receive his
blessing.  Rain might be falling for ten thousand years, yet if our cup is
upside down it will remain empty.  Through praying we open up, we turn our cup
to let the water get inside.  (p.48)

  In Tibetan there is no word for "emotion."
  Bearing in mind that the fundamental goal of Buddhist practice is the
achievement of nirvana, when you study the mind what you're really concerned
with is what specific mental states impede the accomplishment of that end.
That's what the six primary states and twenty derivative states (the
unwholesome mental factors) all have in common.  Some are emotions and some
are not, but it doesn't really matter.  What's important is they all share
that common factor of being impediments.
  In contrast, modern psychology does not have the aim of nirvana.  My
conjecture, in terms of trying to understand why the West places such a strong
emphasis on identifying emotion, is that, going back to the Enlightenment,
even as far back as Aquinas, there is an enormous priority placed on reason
and intelligence.  What can impede reason?  Emotion.
  You have two categories that are set in opposition to each other.  The fact
that there is a specific term for emotion in Western thought does not
necessarily imply that there was a special emphasis placed on understanding
the nature of emotion.  Perhaps initially the motive for labeling something as
emotion was to enhance reason by identifying something that is unreasonable,
something that is irrational.  (p.159)

Question:
  Your Holiness and other teachers tell us to be sincerely joyful about
others' worldly achievements, happiness, and acquisitions.  But if we know
with certainty that a person has acquired or achieved something through
unskillful or non-virtuous means, such as lying, stealing, cheating, harming,
in what manner should that happiness for them be experienced and expressed?

Dalai Lama:
  One's attitude toward superficial successes that are achieved through wrong
means of livelihood such as lying, stealing, cheating, and so on, should not
be the same as for achievements and happiness which are genuine.  However,
here you must bear in mind that if you examine this carefully, you will find
that although the immediate circumstances that gave rise to a person's joy and
happiness may be a wrong means of livelihood, that is merely the immediate
circumstance: the actual cause of that happiness is the individual's merit in
the past.
  So one has to see the difference between immediate circumstances and long-
term causes.  One of the characteristics of karmic theory is that there is a
definite, commensurate relationship between cause and effect.  There is no way
that negative actions or unwholesome deeds can result in joy and happiness.
Joy and happiness, by definition, are the results or fruits of wholesome
actions.  So, from that point of view, it is possible for us to admire not so
much the immediate action, but the real causes of joy.  (p.119)

  At all times, do not lose courage in your inner awareness; uplift yourself,
while assuming a humble position in your outer demeanor.  Follow the example
of the life and complete liberation of previous accomplished masters (siddha).
Do not blame your past karma; instead, be someone who purely and flawlessly
practices the Dharma.  Do not blame temporary negative circumstances; instead,
be someone who remains steadfast in the face of whatever circumstances may
arise.
  In brief, taking your own mind as witness, make your life and practice one,
and at the time of death, with no thought of anything left undone, do not be
ashamed of yourself.  This itself is the pith instruction of all practices.
  Eventually, when the time of death arrives, completely give up whatever
wealth you possess, and do not cling to even one needle.  Moreover, at death,
practitioners of highest faculty will be joyful; practitioners of middling
faculty will be without apprehension; and practitioners of the lowest faculty
will have no regrets.  When realization's clear light becomes continuous day
and night, there is no intermediate state (bardo): death is just breaking the
enclosure of the body.
  If this is not the case, but if you have confidence that you will be
liberated in the intermediate state, whatever you have done in preparation for
death will suffice.  Without such confidence, when death arrives, you can send
your consciousness to whichever pure land you wish and there traverse the
remaining paths and stages to become enlightened.  (p.58)

  There are many different forms of bodywork that can purify and heal in the
context of preparing for tantric practice.  Trauma held in the body from early
experiences is cleared only when we are able to work therapeutically in the
body.  Whether it is body-centered therapy or the various practices of
acupuncture, osteopathy, homeopathy, and so on, if the practice releases and
transforms trauma, then it is beneficial as a preliminary to any further
tantric practice.  I often suggest to people I teach that they follow some
form of body-energy healing in order to further their release of trauma.
Also, after trauma has been released, it is often extremely useful to then
explore some form of psychotherapy.
  We should not assume that the traditional practices will do it all for us.
It is simply idealistic and naive to think that all our ills can be resolved
by doing the traditional preliminary practices or, indeed, by classical
"dharma practice" alone.  We should consider a healthy body-mind-life
relationship as a necessary part of our practice.  When we get this balance
right, we create the basis for a sound dharma practice.
  The practice of tantra in particular needs this healthy, balanced basis
because when we work with tantric practices, we stimulate processes in the
body that are often very powerful.  If we have a sound base for practice and
have a level of emotional and energetic maturity, then the effects of tantra
can be held and grounded without creating the potential for problems to arise.
Without a sound relationship to the body, the practice of tantra has no real
base from which to unfold.(p.53)

The Three Refuges

  What are the methods for causing one's own mind to become the practices?
Initially, one should take refuge and think about actions and their effects.
The refuge is the Three Jewels: Buddha, his Doctrine and the Spiritual
Community.

  [Buddha] When a sentient being purifies the taints of his own mind as well
as their latent predispositions, he is free of all defects that act as
obstructions.  Thus, he simultaneously and directly knows all phenomena.  Such
a being is called a Buddha, and he is a teacher of refuge, like a physician.

  [Dharma] The Doctrine jewel is the superior paths--the chief right paths
which remove the taints as well as their latent predispositions--and the
absences which are states of having removed what is to be removed.  The
Doctrine is the actual refuge, like medicine.

  [Sangha] The Spiritual Community jewel is all persons, whether lay or
ordained, who have generated a superior path in their continuum.  They are
friends helping one to achieve refuge, like nurses.

  The three refuges that have been achieved and presently exist in other
beings' continuums are one's own causal refuge; one relies on a protector just
as a weak person takes refuge in a stronger person.  The three refuges that
one will attain in the future are one's own effect refuge.  One who relies on
the Three Jewels from the point of view of knowing that he is to attain them,
must cause them to be generated in his own continuum.(p.35)

  Buddhism was extremely helpful to me during the process of my sister's
lingering death two years ago.  She was forty-five years old and had very few
spiritual aspirations.  She was actually fearful and closed to any suggestions
that she might find comfort in expanding her degree of awareness and
understanding.  At first I was extremely upset by her attitude, but then I
realized it was not for me to decide what she should or should not do with the
last few months of her life.  I was with her for support and comfort and not
to force her to view her life in a way which was foreign and threatening to
her.
  Enabling a person to accomplish a sense of having lived purposefully and
with significance is a major goal of caregivers and loved ones.  Being able to
support someone during their dying trajectory, regardless of what they are
thinking or feeling is probably one of the most valuable services one person
can offer to another.  But, it is difficult to stay close to someone who is
dying.  Not trying to evade an open encounter with the intense psychic pain
that usually accompanies the recognition of impending death is one of the most
valuable contributions that a nurse or any other caregiver or loved one can
make to the patient who wishes to discuss his or her circumstances.  Facing
forthrightly the situation of dying, however, requires feeling comfortable
with one's own feelings about death and the frailty of being human.
  Buddhism has taught me that death need not be approached only as a tragedy;
it is also an event from which a profound understanding can unfold.  (p.44)

  Offerings should not be influenced by fluctuations of motivation and they
should not be procured by devious means--offerings procured through wrong
means are not good offerings.  They should be arranged with proper motivation.
As explained in the precepts of refuge, you should make offerings of the first
portion of your food or drink of the day, whether it be food, milk or tea.
  Offerings should be made of what is edible; it is not helpful to arrange a
torma that could not be eaten and then to say OM AH HUM, OM AH HUM.  If you
can in reality transform something into delicious food just by reciting OM AH
HUM three times, then it is alright!  On the other hand, if your offerings
remain as mere tsampa (roasted barley flour) after having repeated OM AH HUM a
thousand times, it will not help much.  The offerings should be the best you
can afford.  At least you can offer the first portion of your daily food, as
no one can live without food!  Our offerings should be something which is
edible....  [Even] if you make water offerings in a proper manner, you can
generate great merit.(p.35)

  Hundreds of people may be more popular, powerful, and wealthy than we are,
but from the point of view of the Dharma, no one is more fortunate.  We have a
very precious opportunity to make the best of our lives by working toward the
attainment of buddhahood.  We have obtained this precious human birth and have
come in contact with the teachings and spiritual friends.  All the favorable
conditions are available--we could not ask for more.  Yet this is only for a
very short period of time.  Within this very short time, the best thing we can
do for ourselves is commit ourselves fully and wholeheartedly to practicing
the disciplines, which are an essential part of the practice of the teachings.
  ...The practice of discipline is very profound.  In terms of the
effectiveness of the practice of the Dharma, there is a hundredfold difference
between someone who follows some level of discipline and someone who does not.
Whether visualizing a deity, practicing basic meditation, or reciting mantras,
the benefit is a hundredfold greater when we have the ground of discipline.
  The teachings of the Buddha say that if we take dust from the footprint of a
person who embodies discipline and put it on our heads, it is a blessing.
Even the king of the devas would do that, because of the sacredness of
discipline.  There is a tradition, followed to this day in India, of touching
the feet of a holy person or touching the doorstep before entering his or her
door, and then touching our foreheads.  This is not merely a cultural
tradition, but is acknowledging something very profound.(p.73)

  According to the lower schools of Buddhist thought, when a being, like
Sakyamuni Buddha, attains mahaparinirvana and passes away, he ceases to exist,
there is no further continuity of consciousness.  Therefore, according to the
Vaibhasika school, for example, after this point there is no more being, no
more consciousness.  Only the name remains.  And yet, they believe that this
being who has now disappeared can influence the course of those who follow him
due to the virtues that he created in the past.
  This is not accepted by the higher schools of thought, however, that instead
believe that there are two kinds of bodies, those that are pure in nature and
those that are impure.  The latter is more gross, whereas a body that has been
purified is more subtle.  Now, for example, when Sakyamuni Buddha gave up his
body, there still remained the more subtle one.  So, according to these
schools of thought, at the stage of Buddhahood, there are two bodies: a mental
body and a physical one.  I don't know whether the English word "body" is the
most appropriate one.  In Sanskrit, the words used to signify these two bodies
of the Buddha are dharmakaya and rupakaya.  The first is of the nature of
mind, whereas the latter is material.  So when the Buddha passes away, there
is still this more subtle body, which is of the nature of mind, and since the
mental continuum is also present, we can say that the personality is still
there.  Even today, the Buddha remains as a living being.  I think this is
better, don't you?(p.91)

  Blame everything on one thing.  It simplifies life incredibly, and yet it
truly is not simplistic.  If we believe from our hearts that all of our
misfortunes can be attributed to self-centeredness, this must radically
transform our lives.
  Do we have reservations?  Isn't there some part of the mind that says,
"Self-centeredness is not such a bad idea.  It got me my job, a good salary,
my house and car.  How can this be my enemy?" On the surface self-centeredness
may seem like an aide who looks after our interests.  There is one powerful
answer to this: insofar as self-centeredness dominates our lives, it brings us
into conflict with virtually everyone else.  Because most people are dominated
by self-centeredness, their interests are at odds with our own.  There is
bound to be conflict, and conflict gives rise to suffering.
  Imagine what life would be like without self-centeredness.  Would we give
away all our possessions, waste away from malnutrition, and die prematurely of
disease?  No.  This would be a partial lack of self-centeredness combined with
a large part of stupidity.  If we are to serve others effectively, we must
take care of ourselves.  A bodhisattva has no self-centeredness, but there
have been people in all stations of life, including kings, who are
bodhisattvas.  If we free ourselves of self-centeredness and really concern
ourselves with the cherishing of others, then our own welfare comes as a kind
of echo.(p.67)

  When we achieve a mind focused on mind with the perfect placement of
absorbed concentration, free from all faults of dullness or flightiness, we
increasingly experience an element of bliss accompanying our meditation.  When
we experience serene joy, on both a physical and mental level, brought on by
the force of total absorption of mind on mind, we achieve a meditational state
that fulfills the definition of shamata.
  Our ordinary mind is like raw iron ore that needs to be made into a steel
sword.  Progressing through the stages for attaining shamata is like forging
the iron into steel.  All the materials are there at our disposal.  But since
the mind wanders after external objects, then although it is the material for
attaining shamata, it cannot yet be used as this product.  We have to forge
our mind through a meditational process.  It is like putting the iron ore into
fire.
  To fashion the steel into a sword, or in this analogy to fashion the mind
into an instrument that understands voidness, our serenely stilled and settled
mind needs to come to decisive realization of voidness as its object.  Without
such a weapon of mind, we have no opponent with which to destroy the
disturbing emotions and attitudes.(p.142)

  Focusing the mind on the object of meditation is like planting a seed for
the arisal of the realization....  Even in the beginning stages one might
become impatient, thinking, "I really want to get this done quickly." One
might think that by exerting more effort, by adding more and more stuff, by
changing things this way or that way the process can be made to go faster.
  The good gardener knows that too much water or fertilizer is harmful, not
helpful.  The mature meditator must understand this as well.  The Kadampa
masters of old gave this counsel: First, pay great heed to getting the proper
causes and conditions together.  Next, engage in the practice without
agitation and without anxiety.  Then, with the mind at ease, carry on to the
end.(p.20)

The Need for Reasoning

  All Buddhist schools agree that the analytical reasoning process which leads
to an inference (a conceptual realization) derives from basic, shared, direct
perception.  As an example let us consider the following reasoning:

    A plant does not inherently exist because of being a dependent-arising.

  You begin by reflecting on the fact that a plant is a dependent-arising
because its production depends on certain causes and conditions (such as a
seed, soil, sunlight, and water), but eventually the reasoning process must be
supported by direct perception, or it cannot stand.  We can see with our eyes
that plants change; they grow; mature, and finally dry up.  In this sense,
inference is blind, since it must eventually rely on direct perception.
Inference depends on reasoning, which in turn rests on basic, shared,
indisputable experience through direct perception.  (p.153)

  The root of all qualities of the Bodhisattva vehicle is caring for sentient
beings.  We admire and respect the Buddha because he has reached the state
free of all faults and possessing all good qualities, knows the method to
reach that state, and teaches it to us.  If we do as the Buddha did, by
meditating on love and compassion for all sentient beings, not harming or
getting angry with them, we too can become a Buddha.
  Our enlightenment depends on the Buddhas and on sentient beings, and from
this point of view, they are equally important to us.  Thus when we look at
any sentient being, we should recognize that she is indispensable to our
attainment of enlightenment.  Our enlightenment comes from cherishing sentient
beings; it does not come from cherishing only ourselves.  Understanding this,
whenever we encounter people in our lives, it becomes easy to feel, "May this
person be happy and free from suffering."
  Caring for sentient beings means freeing them from the suffering of
unfortunate rebirths and of cyclic existence in general, teaching the Dharma
to those who want to hear it, providing the means for them to eliminate the
causes which bring suffering temporarily and ultimately, not harming them, not
lying to them, not creating discord among them, not speaking harshly to them,
and so on.  Through caring about them now, excellent results will follow, for
us and for them.(p.179)

  The term 'karma' literally means 'action', and more specifically refers to
the process of cause and effect, where the intention of an agent or being is
involved.  So here karma means an intentional act committed or carried out by
a being who possesses a sentient nature and who is also capable of having a
sentient experience.
  ...Buddhist texts state that only a buddha's omniscient mind can penetrate
the subtlest aspects of the workings of karma, and know at the most
microscopic level which specific causes and conditions give rise to which
specific consequences.  At our level, we can only recognise that an intimate
relationship exists between the external elements of the material world and
the internal elements of our mental world; and, based on that, we can learn to
detect varying levels of subtlety within our mental and emotional experiences.

  All attachment and aversion come from what we have mentally created.  We
have made an image and that is our mind as we normally experience it.  In
order to solve this problem in a more profound and permanent way, we have to
look at our mind and see its true nature.  In our innate, unfabricated nature,
which is the basic state of our mind, there is no problem.  We make all our
problems by creating concepts and all kinds of mental conditioning.
  Seeing the true nature of mind means experiencing the way the mind is when
we do not fabricate and contrive anything.  We need to look at our mind when
it is devoid of our creations and free from mental elaborations.  If we can
see this state of mind, there is no grasping, no grasped object, and no
subject doing the grasping.  There is simply perception or seeing, which in
itself does not cause a problem.
  When the true nature of mind is seen, there are just appearances without any
evaluation.  One thing arises in the mind and then another thing arises.  The
arising that is pleasant is no better than the one that is unpleasant.  They
are simply different manifestations of the mind.  There is no need to grasp
one and reject the other.  Once this is seen clearly, we see the true nature
of mind.  This is something that we need to experience directly.  When we see
the truth, we become liberated from our struggle within the nets of aversion
and attachment.(p.97)

  In general, most non-Buddhist religions meditate on the deity as being
outside the physical body.  In these cases the deity takes the form of a
refuge, or of a protector or messenger.  Thus do they meditate, and of course
this is fine.  In the Buddhist tradition, however, the deity is not meditated
on as being outside the physical body.  One meditates on the deity as being
one's own essence expressing itself through oneself arising as the deity.  One
therefore thinks, "I am the deity," and with this conviction one meditates.
  Why is it justifiable to meditate in this manner?  As previously seen, the
five afflictions are actually self-expressions of the five kinds of primordial
awareness; thus our own mind is in essence exactly the same as the mind of a
Buddha.  In the philosophical treatises this is sometimes referred to as
'sugatagarbha' or 'buddha-nature'.
  Because all beings possess this innately pure buddha-nature, they are pure
by nature and not at all impure.  Being pure by nature it is perfectly
justified to meditate that you are the deity, because this is exactly how it
is! (p.95)

  In day to day life if you lead a good life, honestly, with love, with
compassion, with less selfishness, then automatically it will lead to
nirvana....We must implement these good teachings in daily life.  Whether you
believe in God or not does not matter so much; whether you believe in Buddha
or not does not matter so much; as a Buddhist, whether you believe in
reincarnation or not does not matter so much.  You must lead a good life.
  And a good life does not mean just good food, good clothes, good shelter.
These are not sufficient.  A good motivation is what is needed: compassion,
without dogmatism, without complicated philosophy; just understanding that
others are human brothers and sisters and respecting their rights and human
dignity.  That we humans can help each other is one of our unique human
capacities.  We must share in other peoples' suffering; even if you cannot
help with money, to show concern, to give moral support and express sympathy
are themselves valuable.  This is what should be the basis of activities;
whether one calls it religion or not does not matter....  In my simple
religion, love is the key motivation.(p.20)

  All beings suffer in the same way as we do, and some are even more deeply
immersed in sorrow.  Yet all of these beings wish to experience only happiness
and to avoid all suffering, frustration, and pain.  They wish lasting
happiness but do not know how to cultivate its causes, and they wish to avoid
misery but automatically collect only causes of further misery.  As Shantideva
said, "Although seeking happiness, they destroy their own causes of happiness
as they would an enemy.  And although seeking to avoid misery, they treat its
causes as they would a close friend."
  Were the countless sentient beings unrelated to us, or were they not to mind
their sufferings, perhaps there would be no need for us to bother with their
welfare.  In reality, however, all are related to us and not one of them
wishes to suffer.  Over the billions of lifetimes that we have experienced
since beginningless time, we have known all the living beings again and again.
Sometimes they have been parents to us, sometimes friends or mates, sometimes
enemies.  Without exception, each of them has been even a mother to us again
and again, performing all the kindnesses of a mother.  How can we be
indifferent to them?
  Wishing them to have only happiness and its causes and to be free of
suffering and its causes, we ourselves should generate a sense of
responsibility for their well-being.  Finally, as only an omniscient
Enlightened One is effectively able to benefit beings in deep, lasting, and
ultimate ways, we must quickly attain enlightenment.  This is the wishing
bodhimind, the inner basis of Mahayana practice.(p.136)

  Recalling our interconnectedness, we begin to recognize our total
interdependence and that whatever we enjoy in our life comes through others--
through their efforts, their work, their hardships.
  It does not necessarily require that others had a specific intention to
enable us to enjoy the things of our life.  If we think of this in terms of
the obvious examples like food and clothing, we can immediately see the global
meaning of this contemplation.  Our food comes from all over the world and if
we consider the people and other creatures involved in its production,
picking, packaging, transportation, and selling so that we can enjoy it, the
numbers are vast.  It is through their labor, their efforts, their struggles
that we enjoy what we eat.  Often their lives are terribly hard, and to feed a
family they must work for very little--yet we enjoy the fruits of their labor.
This is something to feel a huge gratitude for.
  If we begin to look more closely at our Western life, we can see how much we
are dependent upon people in considerably poorer circumstances all over the
world for what we consume.  What we often don't consider is the impact of this
consumption on those who produce it.  In this meditation, it can be very
useful to spend some time dwelling upon this so that we really feel the
profound depth of appreciation for our interdependence upon others for our
lives.  This can counter the tendency to take our good fortune for granted and
can open up a sense of gratitude for the kindness of those around.  If guilt
arises, it can be used to increase our awareness of the responsibility we have
globally.
  Gradually, we may begin to see the complete interdependent nature of our
relationship with the countless other beings around us.  We cannot overlook
this connectedness to others and the kindness and benefit we have gained
through them.  When we come to feel this deeply, we will be able to hold
others dear and automatically respond to others with a greater sense of care
and concern.(p.80)

When serving society or others in general, it is very important to set a
proper motivation at the start of each day.  When we wake up each morning, we
reflect, 'Today I am not going to come under the power of either attachment or
hostility.  Today I am going to be of benefit and help to others.' Thus we
consciously set the tone for the entire day so that we go through it within
the context of a pure, altruistic motivation and attitude.

  We all have a certain style for doing things--how we drive, how we cook, how
we dress.  Some of us are shy or cautious, others assertive or flamboyant.
We've refined that style over the years based on how successful it is, but
it's not usually something of which we're completely aware.  As long as it
gets the job done, as long as we get the appropriate feedback from others, our
style goes unnoticed, and when questioned we'll say, "That's just the way I
am."
  When we begin meditation, it is inevitable that we will meditate with the
same style with which we do everything else, because it's who we think we are.
Furthermore, this style has proven to be reasonably successful in our other
activities.  However, in this case, it is not at all appropriate.  If there is
any style, there is a hidden agenda and an implicit judgment of the various
phenomena of meditation.  There is not the true detachment or choiceless
awareness of real meditation.  Our style contains our unacknowledged attitudes
toward meditation.
  ...What's the problem in meditating with an attitude?  First, a large amount
of energy goes into maintaining the attitude.  To make this clearer, if we are
trying to be aware of our breathing, 100 percent of our attention should be on
our breathing.  If we're thinking, "I'm a shy person and I'm a little afraid
of what's going on here," even if we're not consciously aware of that thought,
it will be taking our energy away from the breathing and keeping it tied up in
the world of ego.  Consequently, this energy is not available for our
practice.  And your evaluation of your practice and progress will be based on
your agenda rather than on the Buddha's teaching.
  Of course, no one is a perfect meditator.  It's not like we have to wait
until we have a perfect attitude before we begin.  If that were the case, we
would never start..With time, the purity of your attitude will grow...refining
one's approach is a lifetime's work and is at the same time the practice
itself.(p.72)

  Developing a sense of good cheer in the face of adversity, you can
specifically use adversity as the support for refuge and true spiritual
development.  I am discussing how you relate to your suffering, how you relate
to your adversity, as it affects you in life and on the path.
  Now, as you know, whenever you are suffering by way of the body, speech, and
mind, be it physical illness or a mental affliction, this is a very big deal
to you.  Usually it appears as something major.  Even if it's minor, you make
it into some great distress.  If you lose a little money or if someone speaks
nastily to you, it invokes a strong reaction.  This is called "appearances
arising as the enemy."  When your habituation to adversity reaches such a
point that you actually fall prey to appearances arising as the enemy, it
means that you no longer have patience for suffering.
  ...If you can't bear the minor aspects of adversity in this, the best
rebirth in cyclic existence, the precious human rebirth, what will you do when
you're reborn in the three lower realms?  Samsara is so vast, so deep and
limitless, and the number of sentient beings within samsara are equal to that.
All of them want to be free; all of them desire liberation.  You should
consider then how unnecessary or pointless it is to think that your small
problems in this fortunate life are so great, when in fact they really are
not.
  Any rebirth in this ocean of cyclic existence will by nature bring this type
of discontent or suffering.  Since you've been in this cycle of rebirths from
beginningless time until now and you are still not free, it points out the
fact that help is needed.  Refuge is necessary.  Adversity then becomes the
support for training in refuge, which demonstrates that adversity is used to
your advantage.(p.44)

  The practice of Dharma is to pacify the afflictions and concepts that fill
our minds.  When we blend the teachings with our minds, the power of the
Dharma can act upon and pacify afflictions and concepts.  If on the outside we
look like Dharma practitioners while on the inside our Dharma practice has not
diminished our afflictions or concepts, we merely call ourselves practitioners
without actually being one.  This is not to say that outer behavior, our
reflection in the world, is not important, but what is crucial is to train in
taming our minds.
  What we tame are the three main afflictions: ignorance, attachment, and
aversion.  Ignorance, the root of the two others, is defined as the continual
fixation on our self that we assume to be permanent and independent.  This
ego-clinging is the main cause for our cycling in samsara.  We wish to be in
paradise for our own advantage; we wish to erase all suffering for our own
advantage.  We cling to this "I" of ours, thinking that it is so special that
we should not be bothered with problems but enjoy wealth, power, and charisma.
If we honestly look into our minds, it is quite easy to see this kind of
coarse and obvious grasping to a self.
  There are also subtle forms of fixating on the self ("I") and what belongs
to it ("mine"), like the quick thought of ourselves before another one comes.
When practicing Dharma, we are taming this coarse and subtle clinging to an
ego.  If this does not happen, we will merely be able to suppress the
afflictions temporarily, distancing ourselves for the time being.  To cut
through them completely, we must steadily apply ourselves to practice.(p.187)

    "The mantra of the perfection of wisdom--the mantra of great knowledge,
    the unexcelled mantra, the mantra equal to the unequalled, the mantra
    that quells all suffering--is true because it is not deceptive."
      -- The Heart Sutra

  The perfection of wisdom is called "the mantra of great knowledge" because
thoroughly understanding its meaning eliminates the three poisons of craving,
hatred, and delusion.  It is called the "unexcelled mantra" because there is
no greater method than the perfection of wisdom for saving one from the
extremes of cyclic existence and the isolated peace of individual nirvana.  It
is called the mantra "equal to the unequalled" because the Buddha's
enlightened state is unequalled, and, through the deepest realization of this
mantra, one attains a state equal to that state.  Finally, the perfection of
wisdom is known as the "mantra that quells all suffering" because it quells
manifest sufferings and also removes all propensities for future suffering.
  The perfection of wisdom is the ultimate truth, thus the statement "it is
true." In the realm of the ultimate truth, there is no disparity, as there is
in conventional reality, between appearance and reality, and thus this
manifest ultimate truth is "not deceptive." This nondeceptiveness also
suggests that, through actualization of this mantra, the perfection of wisdom
can enable one to attain total freedom from suffering and its causes.  From
this perspective too, we can say that it is the truth.
  "The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed: tadyatha gate gate
paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!  Shariputra, the bodhisattvas, the great
beings, should train in the perfection of wisdom in this way."

Global Responsibility

  Occasionally I notice that people are making a convenient distinction
between ethics on the personal level and ethics on the wider social level.  To
me, such attitudes are fundamentally flawed, as they overlook the
interdependence of our world.
  That individual ethics--or rather their absence--can have an impact on the
lives of many is powerfully demonstrated by the global financial crisis that
began in 2008, the repercussions of which are still being felt around the
world.  It revealed the way unbridled greed on the part of a few can adversely
affect the lives of millions.  So, just as in the wake of the 9/11 attacks we
started to take the dangers of religious extremism and intolerance seriously,
so too, in the wake of the financial crisis, should we take the dangers of
greed and dishonesty seriously.  When greed is seen as acceptable, even
praiseworthy, there is clearly something wrong with our collective value
system.
  In this age of globalization, the time has come for us to acknowledge that
our lives are deeply interconnected and to recognize that our behavior has a
global dimension.  When we do so, we will see that our own interests are best
served by what is in the best interests of the wider human community.  By
contrast, if we concentrate exclusively on our inner development and neglect
the wider problems of the world, or if, having recognized these, we are
apathetic about trying to solve them, then we have overlooked something
fundamental.  Apathy, in my view, is itself a form of selfishness.  For our
approach to ethics to be truly meaningful, we must of course care about the
world.  This is what I mean by the principle of global responsibility, which
is a key part of my approach to secular ethics.(p.84)

  Speech that is not harmful is the meaning of "right speech." It is wise
speech.  Wise people can still be quite firm and decisive when that is what is
needed.  It means finding generous and productive ways of saying things.
There are times when we need to be strict, but we do not have to denigrate or
harm the person or child who is out of line.  Firm speech can also be wise
speech.
  Wise speech is another tool that can be practiced.  We can begin by
practicing wise speech to ourselves--replacing the inner voice of guilt that
is putting us down and opening a space to listen to our deeper needs.
  What can I say which will be helpful to someone?  What tone of voice will I
use?  And when is it wise to say nothing?  Imagine yourself actually saying
something helpful and supportive.  Imagine the difference it would make in
your life if you could say just one helpful thing to one person.  Imagine your
life if your speech always came from wisdom.(p.136)

The famous nineteenth-century dzogchen master Paltrul Rinpoche explained self-
liberation concretely and precisely:

    The practitioner of self-liberation is like an ordinary person as far as
    the way in which the thoughts of pleasure and pain, hope and fear,
    manifest themselves as creative energy.  However, the ordinary person,
    taking these really seriously and judging them as acceptable or rejecting
    them, continues to get caught up in situations and becomes conditioned by
    attachment and aversion.

    Not doing this, a practitioner, when such thoughts arise, experiences
    freedom: initially, by recognizing the thought for what it is, it is freed
    just like meeting a previous acquaintance; then it is freed in and of
    itself, like a snake shedding its skin; and finally, thought is freed in
    being unable to be of benefit or harm, like a thief entering an empty
    house.

...Freeing or liberating thought does not mean ignoring, letting go of, being
indifferent to, observing, or even not having thoughts.  It means being
present in hope and fear, pain and pleasure, not as objects before us, but as
the radiant clarity of our natural state.  Thus anger, for example, when
experienced dualistically, is an irritation which we may indulge in or reject,
depending on our conditioning.  Either way we are caught up in it and act out
of it.  But when aware of anger as a manifestation of clarity, its energy is a
very fresh awareness of the particulars of the situation.  However, these
particulars are no longer irritating.(p.77)

  In this practice one recollects negativity, contemplates its nature,
generates apprehension of its karmic implications, and resolves to purify
one's mind of the negative traces.  On the basis of this resolve one takes
refuge, develops the bodhimind and enters the Vajrasattva meditation or
whatever method is being used.  One can also do exercises such as prostrations
and so forth.  This concentration of purifying energies destroys the potency
of negative karmic imprints like the germ of a barley seed roasted in a fire.
  Here it is important to begin the meditation session with a contemplative
meditation and then to transform this into settled meditation for a prolonged
period of time.  One abides in the settled meditation until it begins to lose
intensity, and then temporarily reverts to contemplative meditation in order
to invigorate the mind, returning to fixed meditation once a contemplative
atmosphere has been restored.
  Generally our mind is habituated to directing all of our energies into
things that benefit this life alone, things of no spiritual consequence.  By
performing these types of meditations, our natural attachment to the
meaningless activities of this life subsides and we begin to experience an
inner appreciation for spiritual values.  When spontaneously one's mind
appreciates spiritual rather than mundane goals one has become an active
practitioner of initial perspective.(p.117)

  When doing lamrim meditations, it is important to know clearly the state of
mind you want to reach as a conclusion to the meditation.  Lamrim texts
describe the purpose of each meditation, and we want to make sure that our
mind arrives at that conclusion and not at an incorrect or irrelevant
conclusion.  For example, when meditating on the disadvantages of the self-
centered thought, our mind may twist that meditation and conclude, "I'm a
horrible person because I'm so selfish." This is the wrong conclusion to reach
from that meditation.  The Buddha didn't teach the disadvantages of self-
centeredness so that we would deride ourselves.
  If you meditate on a lam rim topic and arrive at an incorrect conclusion,
the meditation hasn't been done correctly.  In the above case, thinking, "I'm
a bad person because I'm so selfish," indicates that we have misunderstood the
purpose of the meditation and probably have fallen into an old pattern of
putting ourselves down.  Stop and ask yourself,
  "What conclusion does the Buddha want me to reach from this meditation?  He
wants me to ascertain that the self-centered mind is the actual 'enemy' that
destroys my happiness.  Self-centeredness is not an intrinsic part of me; it
is not who I am.  It's an incorrect, but deeply entrenched, thought that
creates problems for me.  I can free myself from it.  Since I want to be
happy, I will realize this selfish attitude for what it is and will stop
following it!  Instead, I will cultivate love and compassion for all beings."
  This is the conclusion you want to reach.(p.58)

  Greed is a form of desire.  However, it is an exaggerated form of desire,
based on overexpectation.  The true antidote of greed is contentment.
  For a practicing Buddhist, for a Dharma practitioner, many practices can act
as a kind of counterforce to greed: the realization of the value of seeking
liberation or freedom from suffering, recognizing the underlying
unsatisfactory nature of one's existence, and so on.  These views also help an
individual to counteract greed.  But in terms of an immediate response to
greed, one way is to reflect upon the excesses of greed, what it does to one
as an individual, where it leads.  Greed leads one to a feeling of
frustration, disappointment, a lot of confusion, and a lot of problems.
  When it comes to dealing with greed, one thing which is quite characteristic
is that although it arises from the desire to obtain something, it is not
satisfied by obtaining it.  Therefore, it becomes limitless or boundless, and
that leads to trouble.  The interesting thing about greed is that although the
underlying motive is to seek satisfaction, as I pointed out, even after
obtaining the object of one's desire, one is still not satisfied.  On the
other hand, if one has a strong sense of contentment, it doesn't matter
whether one obtains the object or not; either way, one is still content.(p.32)

  What is the Bodhisattva's Way of life?  It is the way of life that follows
naturally from having cultivated the awakening mind of bodhicitta.
Omniscience is achieved only through the process of purifying the disturbing
emotions within your mind.  It cannot be achieved merely through wishes and
prayers.  We have to train in eliminating all the specific disturbing emotions
within your mind.  We have to train in eliminating all the specific disturbing
emotions by relying on specific antidotes.
  All the activities of a Bodhisattva can be included in two major categories:
the practice of skillful means and the practice of wisdom.  If the practices
of giving, ethics, and so forth are to be perfected, they should be supported
and influenced by the practice of wisdom.  Without the practice of wisdom, the
first five of the six perfections cannot actually become practices of
perfection.  In order to cultivate such wisdom, you must first cultivate the
genuine unmistaken philosophical view that is known as the view of the Middle
Way, or Madhyamika.
  ...even when you have understood the wisdom realizing emptiness, that alone
will not become a powerful antidote to ignorance if it is not supported by
other practices such as giving, ethics, patience, and so forth.  Mere
understanding of selflessness is not sufficient to defeat the disturbing
emotions.(p.76)

  The many tantras of both the Ancient and New traditions unanimously agree
that these, and others, are the consequences of violating the pledges.

    Means of Restoration
    The proclaimers' vows, like a clay pot, once broken cannot be repaired;
    The awakening mind commitments, like gold or silver, can be restored;
    The tantric pledges, like a dented vessel, are restored by the
        practitioner's strength.
      --Jamgon Kongtrul

  When is it possible to restore a vow that has been transgressed?  All the
tantras and transmissions state that if a monk has incurred a defeat with
concealment, the transgressed vow, like a broken clay pot, cannot be repaired.
An awakening mind commitment that has been transgressed is like a cracked gold
or silver vase which can still be soldered by a blacksmith.  A violated vow or
pledge in this Secret Mantra system is likened to a dented golden vessel,
which can be straightened out by the practitioner's own strength.
  Pledges are restored through action, precious substances, earnest desire,
contemplation, and reality.

  How to Become a Receptacle Suitable for Cultivating the Paths. You are

  Concerning this, there are two types: those who merely enter a mandala and
those who enter and receive initiation, of which there are two types.  The
former are those who cannot hold the vows of the five lineages but who hold
the Bodhisattva vows; only the initiation of a student is granted to them.
However, to those who can hold both Bodhisattva and mantra vows the full

  Awareness as virtue.  Beyond choosing more virtuous forms of speech, you can
also try to cultivate awareness of the subtle vibration underlying your speech
and of how your speech manifests from there.  Is your voice creating the right
energy field?
  In dzogchen the concept of virtuous speech is taken to its highest level.
For example, the A-Tri system of dzogchen offers a group of successive
practices in which one learns to maintain awareness while engaging in various
virtuous, neutral, and nonvirtuous activities.
  One initially tries to stay present amid virtuous activity such as praying
or chanting mantras.  Once that experience is stabilized, one integrates
presence with neutral speech, such as conversing casually with a friend about
cooking or gardening.  Finally, one tries to integrate with negative speech
such as lying, arguing, or giving insults.  It is easier if you can establish
your intent for self-awareness before you get drawn into an angry argument.
For example, think of how courtroom lawyers argue a case: although they may
use strong, sharp language, they are never driven by their emotions--every
word is carefully chosen for its impact and is guided by intent, if not
awareness.
  From this perspective "nonvirtuous speech" might be defined as speech that
is driven and not guided and through which you lose connection with your self.
In dzogchen practice you aim to arrive at a place where all activity of body,
speech, and mind becomes an expression of contemplative awareness and an aid
to spiritual development--therefore virtuous in the truest sense of the word.

  Bodhisattvas give solely out of concern for others, without a self-
cherishing attitude.  That is the proper way of giving.  Courageous
Bodhisattvas risk even their lives to help others, and so, when we are in
relatively better, more comfortable situations, we must certainly practice
giving.  Even if they are threatened, the courageous ones will not engage in
improper actions.  Instead, after examining the situation carefully, when they
find that certain actions are correct and justified, on the basis of reason,
they engage in them even at the risk of their lives.  That is the way of the
decent, civilized and courageous ones, who do not follow misleading paths.(p.20)

  Merely understanding the mind is not good enough.  Recognizing it as the
source of happiness and suffering is good, but great results come only from
looking inward and meditating on the nature of the mind.  Once you recognize
its nature, then you need to meditate with joyful effort.  Joyful meditation
will actualize the true nature of the mind, and maintaining the mind in this
natural state will bring enlightenment.  This type of meditation reveals the
innermost, profound wisdom that is inherent in the mind.
  Meditation can transform your body into wisdom light, into what is known as
the rainbow body of wisdom.  Many masters in the history of the Nyingma
lineage have achieved this, as can anyone who practices these methods of
meditation.  The wisdom aspect of our nature exists at all times in each of
us.  You have always had this nature and it can be revealed through
meditation.  When you maintain the mind in its natural state, wonderful
qualities shine out like light from the sun.  Among these qualities are
limitless compassion, limitless loving-kindness, and limitless wisdom.

  In order for the wisdom of special insight to remove impediments to proper
understanding, and to remove faulty mental states at their very roots, we need
concentrated meditation, a state of complete single-mindedness in which all
internal distractions have been removed.
  Single-minded meditation involves removing subtle internal distractions such
as the mind's being either too relaxed or too tight.  To do so we must first
stop external distractions through training in the morality of maintaining
mindfulness and conscientiousness with regard to physical and verbal
activities--being constantly aware of what you are doing with your body and
your speech.  Without overcoming these obvious distractions, it is impossible
to overcome subtler internal distractions.  Since it is through sustaining
mindfulness that you achieve a calm abiding of the mind, the practice of
morality must precede the practice of concentrated meditation.(p.23)

  Buddha means one who is fully enlightened.  In other words, a buddha has
fully awakened from the sleep of delusion.  He is free from all obscurations,
both gross and subtle, and has revealed the two intrinsic wisdom awarenesses.
Buddhahood is the spontaneously established, uncompounded nature that does not
depend on any other conditions.  A buddha has perfect wisdom, has perfectly
accomplished the nature of compassion, and has every ability to manifest all
excellent activities.
  There are many buddhas in the past, present, and future.  In fact, there are
as many buddhas as there are particles of dust.  Basically, the term buddha
refers to anyone whose mind is fully awakened and who is free from all
suffering and its causes.  When we point to Buddha Shakyamuni as a buddha, he
is an example of this.  A buddha has four forms, all of which emanate from the
dharmakaya:
    1.  Nirmanakaya is a buddha who has emanated in a physical form.  A
nirmanakaya can emanate anywhere as anything animate or inanimate--as a human
being, an animal, or even a bridge, if necessary...
    2.  Sambhogakaya is the expression of the complete, perfect manifestation
of the Buddha's excellent, infinite qualities, called the enjoyment body--
splendid and glorious.  All the buddhas appear and manifest in the limitless
buddha fields in this form...
    3.  Dharmakaya is one's own perfection, fully free from all delusion and
suffering.  It is infinite and transcends all boundaries...
    4.  Svabhavikakaya is the indivisible nature of the other three forms.(p.165)

  Boundless joy is the joy you should feel when you see gifted and learned
beings who are happy, famous or influential.  Instead of feeling uneasy and
envious of their good fortune, rejoice sincerely, thinking, "May they continue
to be happy and enjoy even more happiness!" Pray too that they may use their
wealth and power to help others, to serve the Dharma and the Sangha, making
offerings, building monasteries, propagating the teachings and performing
other worthwhile deeds.  Rejoice and make a wish: "May they never lost all
their happiness and privileges.  May their happiness increase more and more,
and may they use it to benefit others and to further the teachings."
  Pray that your mind may be filled with boundless equanimity, loving-
kindness, compassion and joy--as boundless as a Bodhisattva's.  If you do so,
genuine bodhichitta will certainly grow within you.
  The reason these four qualities are boundless, or immeasurable, is that
their object--the totality of sentient beings--is boundless; their benefit--
the welfare of all beings--is boundless; and also their fruit--the qualities
of enlightenment--is boundless.  They are immeasurable like the sky, and they
are the true root of enlightenment.(p.49)

  External circumstances are not what draw us into suffering.  Suffering is
caused and permitted by an untamed mind.  The appearance of self-defeating
emotions in our minds leads us to faulty actions.  The naturally pure mind is
covered over by these emotions and troubling conceptions.  The force of their
deceit pushes us into faulty actions, which leads inevitably to suffering.
  We need, with great awareness and care, to extinguish these problematic
attitudes, the way gathering clouds dissolve back into the sphere of the sky.
When our self-defeating attitudes, emotions, and conceptions cease, so will
the harmful actions arising from them.
  As the great Tibetan yogi Milarepa says, "When arising, arising within space
itself; when dissolving, dissolving back into space."  We need to become
familiar with the state of our own minds to understand how to dissolve ill-
founded ideas and impulses back into the deeper sphere of reality.  The sky
was there before the clouds gathered, and it will be after they have gone.  It
is also present when the clouds seem to cover every inch of the sky we can
see.(p.22)

  Usually the reason that we can't experience transcendent bliss is because
our consciousness is actually chained by the illusion called "I." It is
chained because this concept literally ties our consciousness to the prison of
duality, the prison of concepts and ideas.  What most people experience is
that their consciousness is chained by that illusion.
  But now and then there are people who find the so-called spiritual path.
This is another quite strange and sneaky way that ego can actually keep
binding our consciousness once again to another form of prison, the prison of
duality, the prison of concepts and ideas.  Transcendent bliss comes from
breaking every chain.
  Breaking all chains, losing every concept, every idea, sounds very
frightening to the ego's mind.  But actually when we let go of every concept,
we land on this infinite ground of eternal bliss, and that bliss is not some
kind of religious or mystical experience, some altered state of consciousness.
That bliss is not the result of doing something to our consciousness, rather
it is the pure state of our consciousness.(p.74)

  The all-base consciousness* works like a savings bank.  Continuously money
is paid into the bank and continuously it is taken out again.  In the same way
karmic imprints are absorbed by the all-base, are stored there, and can
therefore be brought forth again.
  Learning, for example, occurs through the mind consciousness.  The mind
consciousness itself vanishes.  Nevertheless, on the next day we have a memory
of what we learned.  At this time of remembrance, the mind consciousness of
what we learned is no longer actually present, since it has ceased to exist.
Yet, still we did not forget what we learned previously.  What we learned was
seized by the all-base in the form of karmic imprints, and stored.  Due to the
'all-base of complete ripening' these imprints can be re-awakened, so that the
mind consciousness perceives them afresh.  This is why we learn things.  It is
similar with strong mental afflictions.
  ...The example of the savings bank is particularly effective, especially in
the context of karmic actions.  Whoever puts money into the bank can get it
out again later, often including interest!(p.37)

  Q: How can Dzogchen help us in our daily jobs and careers?

  HHDL: In the first place, it is quite difficult to have an experience of
Dzogchen.  But once you do have that experience, it can be extremely
beneficial in dealing with your day to day life, your job, and your career.
This is because that kind of experience will give you the ability to prevent
yourself from being overwhelmed by circumstances, good or bad.  You will not
fall into extreme states of mind: you will not get over-excited or depressed.
Your attitude toward circumstances and events will be as if you were someone
observing the mind, without being drawn away by circumstances.
  For example, when you see a reflection of a form in a mirror, the reflection
appears within the mirror but it is not projected from within.  In the same
way, when you confront the situations of life, or deal with others, your
attitude too will be mirror-like.
  Also, when a reflection appears in the mirror, the mirror does not have to
go after the object that is reflected: it simply reflects, spontaneously, on
the surface.  The same with you: since there is no attachment or agitation at
having these 'reflections' in your mind, you will feel tremendous ease and
relief.  You are not preoccupied by what arises in the mind, nor does it cause
you any distress.  You are free from conceptuality or any form of
objectifying.  And so it really does help you, in allowing you to be free from
being caught up in the play of emotions like hatred, attachment, and the like.

  The quality of one's rebirth in the next life is determined by the quality
of one's mental activity in this life.  Generally speaking, we have no power
to choose how we are born; it is dependent on karmic forces.  However, the
period near the time of death is very influential in terms of activating one
from among the many karmas that a person has already accumulated, and,
therefore, if one makes particular effort at generating a virtuous attitude at
that time, there is an opportunity to strengthen and activate a virtuous
karma.  Moreover, when one has developed high realization and has gained
control over how one will be reborn, it is possible to take what is called
"reincarnation" rather than mere rebirth.(p.42)

  Without an acute awareness of our personal suffering and a deep, heartfelt
determination to be completely rid of both this suffering and its causes,
there is no way to begin the spiritual quest authentically.  For just as
Prince Siddhartha's sudden and unexpected visions of old age, sickness and
death shocked him out of mistaking the world to be a pleasure palace, so too
must all spiritual seekers confront the unsatisfactory nature of their lives
so directly that they become thoroughly disenchanted with the ordinary human
condition.
  If we do not take a long, hard look at the uncomfortable truths of our
impermanent existence, we can easily waste the time between now and our
inevitable death in essentially worthless pursuits, never taking advantage of
this precious opportunity to do something truly meaningful with our life.
Like the foolish prisoner who becomes so accustomed to the confines of his
cell that he turns a blind eye to all chances of escape, we shall be
condemning ourselves to spiritual stagnation and the endlessly recurring
miseries of cyclic existence.
  Yet it is not enough merely to become discontent with our present condition;
everyone experiences discontent at one time or another but very few do
anything of real significance about it.  In fact, the usual ways of dealing
with problems and disappointment--blaming them on someone else or drowning
them in forgetfulness--only bind us tighter to the wheel of suffering.  What
we must do is recognize that the true causes of all our misery lie rooted in
our own ignorant misconceptions and that these can only be eradicated through
the development of a clear, penetrating insight into the nature of reality.
Only through the continued cultivation of such penetrating wisdom will it
eventually be possible to attain liberation from all states of existence
conditioned by ignorance and be free of suffering.(p.45)

  We must distinguish between pride and self-confidence.  Self-confidence is
necessary.  It is what enables us, in certain situations, not to lose courage
and to think with some justification, 'I am capable of succeeding.' Self-
confidence is quite different from excessive self-assurance based on a false
appreciation of our capacities or circumstances.
  If you feel able to accomplish a task that other people cannot manage, then
you cannot be called proud as long as your assessment is well founded.  It is
as if someone tall came across a group of short people who wanted to get
something too high for them to reach, and said to them, 'Don't exert
yourselves, I can do it.' This would simply mean that he was more qualified
than the others to carry out a particular task, but not that he is superior to
them or that he wants to crush them.(p.259)

  What is progress?  How do we recognize it?  The teachings are like a mirror
before which we should hold our activities of body, speech, and mind.  Think
back to a year ago and compare the stream of activities of your body, speech,
and mind at that time with their present condition.  If we practice well, then
the traces of some improvement should be reflected in the mirror of Dharma.
  The problem with having expectations is that we usually do not expect the
right things.  Not knowing what spiritual progress is, we search for signs of
it in the wrong areas of our being.  What can we hope for but frustration?  It
would be far better to examine any practice with full reasoning before
adopting it, and then to practice it steadily and consistently while observing
the inner changes one undergoes, rather than expecting this or that fantasy to
become real.
  The mind is an evolving organism, not a machine that goes on and off with
the flip of a switch.  The forces that bind and limit the mind, hurling it
into unsatisfactory states of being, are impermanent and transient agents.
When we persistently apply the practices to them, they have no option but to
fade away and disappear.
  Ignorance and the "I"-grasping syndrome have been with us since
beginningless time, and the instincts of attachments, aversion, anger,
jealousy and so forth are very deeply rooted in our mindstreams.  Eliminating
them is not as simple as turning on a light to chase away the darkness of a
room.  When we practice steadily, the forces of darkness are undermined, and
the spiritual qualities that counteract them and illuminate the mind are
strengthened and made firm.  Therefore, we should strive by means of both
contemplative and settled meditation to gain stability in the various Lam Rim
topics.(p.176)

  We are beings of the Desire Realm, and thus our minds are also included
within Desire Realm minds.  If we cultivate great compassion, our own minds
are the basis for great compassion.  By contemplating countless sentient
beings and meditating to develop great compassion, one eventually achieves
great compassion.  At that point, the mental basis--one's own mind--has become
of the entity of great compassion.  There is no distinguishing the two at that
time.  Meditating on great compassion does not mean taking compassion as an
object and looking at it; it means taking sentient beings as one's object and
developing compassion for them such that the mind comes to be of the nature of
great compassion.
  The texts frequently speak of different mental bases: the basis for calm
abiding, the basis for meditative absorption, the basis for achieving a path.
The way of understanding all of these is the same.  You may wonder whether,
when one cultivates a certain path, the mind becomes of the entity of that
path.  It is important to understand this question because that is, in fact,
what occurs when one cultivates calm abiding.  The mental basis becomes of the
nature of calm abiding.

  Nature's law dictates that, in order to survive, bees must work together.
As a result, they instinctively possess a sense of social responsibility.
They have no constitution, no law, no police, no religion or moral training,
but because of their nature, they labor faithfully together.  Occasionally,
they may fight, but in general, based on cooperation, the whole colony
survives.
  We human beings have a constitution, laws and a police force.  We have
religion, remarkable intelligence and a heart with a great capacity for love.
We have many extraordinary qualities, but in actual practice, I think we are
lagging behind those small insects.  In some respects I feel we are poorer
than the bees.

  Nagarjuna offers us encouragement in terms of someone of modest potential
accomplishing the practice, in verse 116:

        And even those who realized the truth
        Did not fall from the heavens, nor emerge
        Like crops of corn from earth's dark depths, but once
        Were ruled by kleshas and were ordinary men.

  Not one of all the sublime beings who have appeared--individuals who had
direct realization of the Dharma of the four truths--was already a sublime
being right from the beginning: they did not fall from the sky, nor did they
emerge from the darkness of the earth like a crop.  In the past they were
subject to afflictive emotions ['kleshas']--they were ordinary people
dominated by the afflictive emotions.  They are therefore worth following as
an example for accomplishing the path.(p.150)

Our sense of self

  As long as we cling to some notion of objective existence--the idea that
something actually exists in a concrete, identifiable way--emotions such as
desire and aversion will follow.  When we see something we like--a beautiful
watch, for example--we perceive it as having some real quality of existence
among its parts.  We see the watch not as a collection of parts, but as an
existing entity with a specific quality of watch-ness to it.  And if it's a
fine mechanical timepiece, our perception is enhanced by qualities that are
seen to exist definitely as part of the nature of the watch.  It is as a
result of this misperception of the watch that our desire to possess it
arises.
  In a similar manner, our aversion to someone we dislike arises as a result
of attributing inherent negative qualities to the person.  When we relate this
process to how we experience our own sense of existence--how the thought "I"
or "I am" arises--we notice that it invariably does so in relation to some
aspect of our physical or mental aggregates.
  Our notion of ourselves is based upon a sense of our physical and emotional
selves.  What's more, we feel that these physical and mental aspects of
ourselves exist inherently.  My body is not something of which I doubt the
specificity.  There is a body-ness as well as a me-ness about it that very
evidently exists.  It seems to be a natural basis for my identifying my body
as "me." Our emotions such as fear are similarly experienced as having a valid
existence and as being natural bases for our identifying ourselves as "me."
Both our loves and our hates serve to deepen the self sense.  Even the mere
feeling "I'm cold" contributes to our sense of being a solid and legitimate
"I."(p.61)

  In the Mahayana, there exist the vows of the Bodhisattva... but in Dzogchen,
there exist no such rules or vows.
  When the Indian Buddhist master Atisa came to Tibet in the eleventh century,
he met the famous Tibetan translator Rinchen Zangpo.  Atisa asked him how he
practiced the Tantras which he had translated, and he replied that he
practiced them meticulously one after the other.  But Atisa told him that this
was not the correct way.  He pointed out to the translator that all of the
Tantras could be condensed and integrated into a single Upadesa and one need
only practise that in order to maintain all of the transmissions which he had
received.
  The same is true with Dzogchen.  If we really understand this single
teaching here which comes directly from Guru Padmasambhava, we can attain
liberation.  But we must grasp this vital core of the teaching.  No matter
what we are doing, which ever among the four modes of behavior--walking,
sitting, lying down, or eating, we must always hold to awareness, never
forgetting, never losing this awareness.  This is the real meaning of Rigdzin,
one who is totally aware.  In Dzogchen, there is only one rule--always be
aware in whatever we do, never be distracted!(p.68)

  Our mind needs to stretch to encompass emptiness.  Our minds are so stuck in
the idea, "Things exist the way they appear to me.  What I see is reality.  It
is 100 percent true.  There's nothing to doubt.  Things exist exactly as they
appear to my senses, exactly as they appear to my mental consciousness." We
hardly ever doubt that.  Not only do we have the appearance of inherent
existence to our sense consciousnesses and mental consciousness, but also our
mental consciousness grasps on to that appearance and says, "Yes!  Everything
really exists in this findable, independent way.  Everything is real as it
appears to me."
  When we believe there's a real "me," then we have to protect that self and
bring it happiness.  Thus, we are attached to things that are pleasurable and
become angry at anything unpleasant.  Pride, jealousy, laziness, and the whole
gamut of negative emotions follow.  Motivated by these, we act physically,
verbally, and mentally.  These actions, or karma, leave seeds on our
mindstream, and when these ripen, they influence what we experience.  We again
relate to these experiences ignorantly, so more emotions arise, motivating us
to create more karma.  As a result, cyclic existence with all its difficulties
continues on and on, created by our mind, dependent on the ignorance that
misconceives the nature of ourselves and all other phenomena.
  ...However, when we investigate more deeply and look beyond appearances, we
realize that it's impossible for things to exist in the way they appear.
Seeing this gives us a kind of spaciousness and freedom because, if samsara
were inherently existent and everything really did exist the way it appears to
us, then transformation and change could not occur...and the best we could
ever have is what we have right now.  Thinking about the emptiness of inherent
existence shows us the possibility for change.  Beauty can come forth because
nothing is inherently concrete, fixed, or findable.(p.105)

Three Meditations

      If one does not sow the seed
      Of appreciation for a perfect guru,
      The tree of spiritual power is not born.
      With undivided mind entrust yourself.

      Human life is rare and precious,
      Yet if not inspired by thoughts of death,
      One wastes it on materialism:
      Be ready to die at any moment.

      All living beings have been our mothers,
      Three circles of suffering always binding them.
      Ignoble it would be not to repay them,
      Not to strive to attain enlightenment.  (p.100)

  The colophon [inscription] for this poem reads, "Written at the request of
Ritropa Samdrub, an Amdo monk from Dechen Monastery, who begged for a short
teaching...." The Seventh Dalai Lama advises him to establish three central
pillars in his spiritual practice: (1) a disciplined spiritual connection with
his teacher; (2) awareness of the preciousness of life, and the uncertainty of
the time of death; and (3) the mind of love and compassion for all living
beings, coupled with the aspiration to enlightenment as the best means of
fulfilling that love and compassion.

  Courageous Bodhisattvas risk their lives to help others, and so, when we are
in relatively better, more comfortable situations, we must certainly practice
giving.  Even if they are threatened, the courageous ones will not engage in
improper actions.  Instead, after examining the situation carefully, when they
find that certain actions are correct and justified, on the basis of reason,
they engage in them even at the risk of their lives.  That is the way of the
decent, civilized and courageous ones, who do not follow misleading paths.(p.20)

  One day, when a very learned scholar or geshe and I were discussing the fact
that the self is an elusive phenomenon, that it is unfindable in either body
or mind, he remarked: 'If the self did not exist at all, in a sense that would
make things very simple.  There would be no experience of suffering and pain,
because there would be no subject to undergo such experiences.  However, that
is not the case.  Regardless of whether we can actually find it or not, there
is an individual being who undergoes the experience of pain and pleasure, who
is the subject of experiences, who perceives things and so on.  Based on our
own experience we do know that there is something--whatever we may call it--
that makes it possible for us to undergo these experiences.  We have something
called discernment or the ability to perceive things.'
  In fact, when we examine the experience of suffering, although some
sufferings are at the sensory or bodily level, such as physical pain, even the
very experience of pain is intimately connected with consciousness or mind and
therefore is part of our mental world.  This is what distinguishes sentient
beings from other biological organisms, such as plants, trees and so on.
Sentient beings have a subjective dimension, which we may choose to call
experience, consciousness or the mental world.
  ....One thing we can understand, both through scientific analysis and also
from our own personal experience or perception, is that whatever experiences
we have now are consequences of preceding conditions.  Nothing comes into
being without a cause.  Just as everything in the material world must have a
cause or condition that gives rise to it, so must all experiences in the
mental world also have causes and conditions.(p.74)

  Meditation, when learned skillfully, can enable a return to awareness of the
body, our sensations, and feelings.  When we are not given specific guidance
to ground our meditation within the body, however, meditation can easily
perpetuate a disembodied spiritual practice.  This is accentuated if our view
of spirituality sees the body as some kind of problem to be transcended.
Unfortunately, this view can prevail even within the Buddhist world, despite
being counter to the essential principle of mindfulness and presence.  When,
however, we cultivate the capacity to remain present in our felt experience
within the body, our relationship to ourselves changes.  We can begin to feel
more grounded in our life and more stable in our identity.
  Engaging in a disembodied spirituality is no solution to our life demands.
It may be a way of experiencing states of mind that can be very seductive,
even addictive.  Seldom does it address the roots of our emotional problems.
Transformation comes when we are willing and able to restore or develop a
sound relationship to our body in a healthy way.  With many Buddhist
practices, such as Tantra, this is essential, for the body contains the
vitality that is the heart of our innate creative potential.
  Embodiment therefore implies a full engagement in life with all of its
trials and tribulations, rather than avoidance through disembodied spiritual
flight.  The value of meditation is that it can enable this engagement because
it cultivates the capacity to be present and remain open, not grasping at or
rejecting what arises.  When meditation emphasizes presence rather than
transcendence, this openness is a natural outcome.(p.143)

  Those training in great love should forsake self-centeredness and engage in
the Buddha's practice, the root of which is compassion.  You may be thinking,
Love is indeed very profound, but I do not have the skill to practice it; I
will focus my efforts on practices aimed at getting myself out of cyclic
existence instead.  On one hand, this is true, because you should choose a
path of development appropriate to your ability.  On the other hand, there is
great advantage in attempting the highest degree of love you can.
  Even if you cannot actually implement the practices of love and compassion,
merely hearing about them establishes powerful predispositions for future
success.  This can be amplified by planting prayer-wishes aspiring to
altruism.  Do not be discouraged; it is difficult to absorb such a profound
perspective.  Be courageous and think of your future potential.  It is
particularly important to do the best you can.(p.82)

  What is very important for us to recognise is our own falsity.  This is not
a judgement that sometimes we are authentic and sometimes we are false.  It
means that everything about us in our ordinary sense of self is false because
it is grounded on a misapprehension of the nature of reality....  It is like
somebody in University who is having their final examinations.  They go into
the wrong examination room and not reading the questions very clearly they
write very long answers on their own subject that is unfortunately not the one
they are being examined on.  It does not matter how good the answer is they
will fail, for they are not addressing the question.
  The basic question is always: "Who are you?", "Who am I?" but we do not
understand it and so we answer with a ceaseless narrative of self definition.
This covers over the freshness of the question, the possibility of looking and
seeing, and so all our answers are stale, the reworking of self-protective
versions constructed out of unexamined elements.  We have many, many, many
answers and all of them are false.  That's why it is very important when you
do meditations, to put your full energy one-pointedly into the practice, to
try to repair the initial basic fault that has torn subject and object apart.
  It is very important to stop being ashamed of being false.  For we have to
see how falsity arises, how obscuration develops.  We want to look directly at
our falsity and learn its tricks so that we will not be caught by them.  This
helps to open the space in which we can recognise our own nature.
  "When you understand the falsity of your confusion remain unartificially,
effortlessly in the natural mode (dharmakaya)."(p.90)

groundhog daze:
  this is an event that can be caused by strong intoxication of various sorts.
the sufferer passes out while seated at a table, such that he or she then has
their head thud down onto the table.  after a brief rest, the unlucky person
wakes up again, and starts to rise off the table.  when the head rises to a
certain point, where blood pressure starts to increase, the effect of the
intoxication takes over again, and they pass out once more.  bam.  hence, the
head repeatedly banging into the table: a groundhog daze.

  We are the source of healing and happiness.  Our generosity and concern
pacify every negative situation.  As we send out kindness, we grow accustomed
to being strong and kind.  In this way, our positive feelings are constantly
renewed and can never be exhausted.
  Perhaps you know the story about the man who arrived in heaven and when
asked by God where he wanted to go replied that he wanted to see both heaven
and hell.  First, he went to hell.  There was a large table with all the
inhabitants of hell sitting around it.  The center of the table was full of
delicious food.  Each person had two very long chopsticks.  They could reach
the food but they could not get it into their mouths because their chopsticks
were too long.  They were miserable.  No one was eating and everyone went
hungry.  Next he was taken to visit heaven.  All the inhabitants of heaven
were also sitting around a big table full of delicious food but they were
happy.  They too had very long chopsticks but they were eating and enjoying
themselves.  They used the chopsticks to feed each other across the table.
The people in heaven had discovered that it was in their interest to
collaborate unselfishly.(p.69)

  When you are in a fluctuating state of mind, like when you are angry or have
lost your temper, then it is good to bring back calmness by concentrating on
breathing.  Just count the breaths, completely forgetting about anger.
Concentrate on breathing and count in/out "one, two, three," up to twenty.
  At that moment when your mind concentrates fully on breathing, the breath
coming and going, the passions subside.  Afterwards it is easier to think
clearly.
  Since all activities, including meditation, depend very much on the force of
intention or motivation, it is important that, before you begin to meditate,
you cultivate a correct motivation...  The correct motivation is the
altruistic attitude.(p.69)

    The crazy elephant of the mind behaving wildly
    Is tied to the pillar of an object of observation
    With the rope of mindfulness.
    By degrees it is brought under control with the hook of wisdom.
      --Bhavaviveka

  "Wisdom" here is introspection.  Hence, the example of taming an elephant
indicates the achievement of a serviceable mind by way of the two--mindfulness
and introspection.  The subtle vajra that is the base on which the mind is
being set is like a stable pillar to which an elephant is tied.  The
unserviceable mind is like an untamed elephant.  Causing the mind not to be
distracted from its object of observation through relying on mindfulness is
like using a rope to tie an elephant.  Setting the mind free from fault--when
it does not hold the object of observation as originally set--through
immediately recognizing such by means of introspection is like a herder's
hitting an elephant with a hook and correcting it when it strays from the tie-
up.

  Hence, there are two important factors with regard to holding the mind:
    + From the beginning, stay on the object of observation without being
      distracted to anything other than it.
    + Then if distracted, immediately recognize such, and again focus the mind
      as before. (p.94)

What Do We Mean by Bodhisattva?

  Bodhi means enlightenment, the state devoid of all defects and endowed with
all good qualities.  Sattva refers to someone who has courage and confidence
and who strives to attain enlightenment for the sake of all beings.  Those who
have this spontaneous, sincere wish to attain enlightenment for the ultimate
benefit of all beings are called bodhisattvas.  Through wisdom, they direct
their minds to enlightenment, and through their compassion, they have concern
for beings.  This wish for perfect enlightenment for the sake of others is
what we call bodhichitta, and it is the starting point on the path.
~
The Notion of Self

  When we talk about the notion of self in Buddhism, it is important to bear
in mind that there are different degrees or types.  There are some types of
sense of self which are not only to be cultivated but also to be reinforced
and enhanced.  For instance, in order to have a strong determination to seek
buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings, one needs a very strong
sense of confidence, which is based upon a sense of commitment and courage.
This requires a strong sense of self.  Unless one has that identity or sense
of self, one will not be able to develop the confidence and courage to
strongly seek this aim.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama

Genuine peace of mind is rooted in affection and compassion.  There is a very
high level of sensitivity and feeling involved.  So long as we lack inner
discipline, an inner calmness of mind, then no matter what external facilities
or conditions we may have, they will never give us the feeling of joy and
happiness that we seek.  On the other hand, if we possess this inner
quality—that is, calmness of mind, a degree of stability within—then even
if we lack various external facilities that are normally considered necessary
for a happy and joyful life, it is still possible to live a happy and joyful
life.

COMPLICATED SIMPLICITY

  Emptiness is the simplest and most unelaborated thing we could imagine, but
then there is this whole literature about all these very discursive details
with all their subpoints.  There are five paths and ten bhumis, and each path
is divided into a number of stages, with certain numbers of obscurations
having to be relinquished on each one of those subpaths.  Most people just
think, "Who wants or needs to know all that?  Don't we have too many
thoughts already?  I thought this was about letting go of all reference
points."
  Of course nobody really wants to know all those details and in a sense we
all know them already, because they are the details of the many reference
points that we already have in our mind.  The fact that these sutras and their
commentaries talk about our obscurations is precisely the point why they seem
so endless and complicated—because our minds are complicated.  Emptiness is
extremely simple, but our convoluted minds that do not get this simplicity are
very complicated.  It is not that the Buddha and the other speakers in the
sutras and the commentaries really like to, but they need to address each one
of those knots in our minds, which are like knots in space.

THE MIND OF CLEAR LIGHT

  Is spiritual practice really worthwhile?  Is it really possible to eliminate
from within ourselves the forces that give rise to suffering?  As is said,
"The ultimate nature of mind is clear light." Consciousness has many
levels, and although the coarser levels are affected by the defiling forces,
the most subtle level remains free of gross negativities.  In the Vajrayana
this subtle level of consciousness is called the mind of clear light.
  The delusions and emotional afflictions as well as the dualistic mind of
right and wrong, love and hatred, etc., are associated only with the coarse
levels of consciousness.  At the moment, we are totally absorbed in the
interplay of these coarse states, so we must begin our practice by working
within them.  This means consciously encouraging love over hate, patience in
place of anger, emotional freedom rather than attachment, kindness over
violence, and so forth.  Doing this brings immediate peace and calm to the
mind, thus making higher meditation possible.
  Then, because grasping at a self and at phenomena as being truly existent is
the cause of all the vast range of distorted states of mind, one cultivates
the wisdom that eliminates this ego-grasping.  To overcome ego-grasping is to
overcome the entire host of mental distortions.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
It is the general Buddhist procedure that one's own pleasure and pain are
acheived by oneself and not from the outside, and that, therefore, sentient
beings themselves must understand and implement practices to bring about their
own happiness.  Thus, the most efficacious way to help others is through
teaching what should be adopted in practice and what should be discarded from
among current behavior.  There is no way to do this unless you come to know
all of the topics involved in what should be adopted in practice and what
should be discarded—you must become omniscient.  As mentioned earlier, there
is no way to accomplish this except by removing the obstructions to
omniscience, and one who has overcome, utterly and forever, the obstructions
to omniscience is a Buddha.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  In meditation, imagine that in front of you are three persons—an enemy, a
friend, and a neutral person.  At that time, in our minds we have (1) a sense
of closeness for one of them, thinking, "This is my friend"; (2) a sense
of dislike even when imagining the enemy; and (3) a sense of ignoring the
neutral person.  Now, we have to think about the reasons why we generate these
feelings—the reasons being that temporarily one of them helped us whereas
the other temporarily harmed us, and the third did neither.  However, when we
think in terms of the long course of beginningless rebirth, none of us could
decide that someone who has helped or harmed us in this life has been doing so
for all lifetimes.
  When you contemplate this way, eventually you arrive at a point where a
strong generation of desire or hatred appears to you to be just senseless.
Gradually, such a bias weakens, and you decide that one-sided classification
of persons as friends and enemies has been a mistake.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  Generally speaking, even if money brings us happiness, it tends to be the
kind that money can buy: material things and sensory experiences.  And these,
we discover, become a source of suffering themselves.  As far as actual
possessions are concerned, we must admit that they often cause us more, not
less, difficulty in life.  The car breaks down, we lose our money, our most
precious belongings are stolen, our house is damaged by fire.  Or we worry
about these things happening.
  The problem is not materialism as such.  Rather it is the underlying
assumption that full satisfaction can arise from gratifying the senses alone.
Unlike animals whose quest for happiness is restricted to survival and to the
immediate gratification of sensory desires, we human beings have the capacity
to experience happiness at a deeper level, which, when achieved, can overwhelm
unhappy experiences.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
We humans are social beings.  We come into the world as the result of
others' actions.  We survive here in dependence on others.  Whether we like
it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives in which we do not benefit
from others' activities.  For this reason it is hardly surprising that most
of our happiness arises in the context of our relationships with others.  Nor
is it so remarkable that our greatest joy should come when we are motivated by
concern for others.  But that is not all.  We find that not only do altruistic
actions bring about happiness, but they also lessen our experience of
suffering.  Here I am not suggesting that the individual whose actions are
motivated by the wish to bring others happiness necessarily meets with less
misfortune than the one who does not.  Sickness, old age, mishaps of one sort
or another are the same for us all.  But the sufferings which undermine our
internal peace—anxiety, doubt, disappointment—these are definitely less.

Emptiness vs. Non-Existence

The doctrines of emptiness and selflessness do not imply the non-existence of
things.  Things do exist.  When we say that all phenomena are void of self-
existence, it does not mean that we are advocating non-existence, that we are
repudiating that things exist.  Then what is it we are negating?  We are
negating, or denying, that anything exists from its own side without depending
on other things.  Hence, it is because things depend for their existence upon
other causes and conditions that they are said to lack independent self-
existence.

  The process of overcoming our defilements goes in conjunction with gaining
higher levels of realisation.  In fact, when we speak of gaining higher levels
of realisation in Buddhism we are speaking primarily of the processes through
which our wisdom and insight deepen.  It is actually the wisdom aspect that
enables the practitioner to move from one level to the next on the path.
  The attainment of the levels of the path is explained in condensed form in
the Heart Sutra, where we find the mantra tadyatha om gate gate paragate
parasamgate bodhi svaha.  Tadyatha means It is thus; gate gate means go, go;
paragate means go beyond and transcend; parasamgate means go utterly beyond,
go thoroughly beyond; and bodhi svaha means firmly rooted in enlightenment.

ENDURING SUCCESS
  It is often seen that human beings can endure problems quite well, but
cannot endure success.  When we are successful and have everything we desire,
it can easily go to our heads.  There is a great danger of losing our common
sense and becoming careless and arrogant.  As it is said, "Nothing corrupts a
person more than power." Very powerful people sometimes become so proud that
they no longer care about their actions or about the effect they have on
others.  Losing any sense of right and wrong, they create severe problems for
themselves and everyone else.
  Even if we have all the success we could dream of—fame, wealth, and so
on—we must understand that these things have no real substance.  Attachment
does not come from having things, but from the way our mind reacts to them.
It is fine to participate in good circumstances, provided we can see that they
have no real essence.  They may come and they may go.  When seeing this, we
will not become so attached.  Even if we lose our wealth we will not be badly
affected, and while it is there we will enjoy it without being senseless and
arrogant.

The role of other sentient beings

  In relation to the attainment of liberation from cylic existence, which is
known also as "definite goodness," the role of other sentient beings is
indispensable.  In the Buddhist understanding, the key spiritual practices
that lead to the attainment of liberation are the Three Higher
Trainings—higher training in morality, in meditation, and in wisdom.  The
last two are based upon the foundation of the first, namely the training in
morality.  As I said before, the presence of other sentience beings is
indispensable for this training.  This is how we come to the powerful
realisation that the role of other sentient beings is essential in all areas
of our mundane and spiritual activities.

  To avoid being hurt by thorns and brambles, we might consider covering all
the mountains with leather.  That would be impossible, but putting on shoes
would serve the same purpose.  Similarly, if we tried to subdue all our outer
enemies, we would never succeed.  Once one was eliminated, another would rise
against us.  While doing this, our anger would continue to breed new foes.
The only way to overcome our enemies is to turn inward and kill the real one,
which is our own hatred.

  One should not view one's dharma practice as being something decorative,
regarding statues and images as material possessions or as furnishings for
one's house, or thinking that because there is an empty space on a wall one
might as well put up a thangka for decoration.  That kind of attitude should
not be cultivated.  When you arrange the statues or thangkas, you should do so
out of a deep respect from the mind, moved by your faith and conviction.  If
you can arrange these physical representations—statues and so forth—out of
deep respect and faith, that's all right.  On the other hand, the attitude
that they are merely material possessions is dangerous and destructive.  I
think that some people who have a cupboard or the like in which they keep all
their precious possessions may arrange an altar on it just for the sake of
decoration.  This is very wrong.
  Having such motivations is not the proper way to become a Buddhist; the
proper way to become a Buddhist is to bring about some positive change within
the mind.  Any practice that can give you more courage when you are undergoing
a very difficult time and that can provide you with some kind of solace and
calmness of mind is a true practice of the dharma.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
The environment where you are doing the meditation should be properly cleaned.
While cleaning, you should cultivate the motivation that since you are engaged
in the task of accumulating great stores of merit by inviting the hosts of
buddhas and bodhisattvas to this environment, it is important to have a clean
place.  You should see that all external dirt and dust around you is basically
a manifestation of the faults and stains within your own mind.  You should see
that the most important aim is to purge these stains and faults from within
your mind.  Therefore, as you cleanse the environment, think that you are also
purifying your mind.  Develop the very strong thought that by cleaning this
place you are inviting the hosts of buddhas and bodhisattvas who are the most
supreme merit field, and that you will subsequently engage in a path that will
enable you to purge your mind of the stains and delusions.

  From the point of view of one who seeks enlightenment, it is far better to
be a human being than to be born even in the heavens of the gods, where there
is nectar to live on and all wishes are granted by the wish-fulfilling tree;
where there is neither fatigue nor difficulty, neither sickness nor old age.
It is as humans, possessed of the eight freedoms and the ten endowments, and
not as gods, that every one of the thousand Buddhas of this age has attained,
or will attain, enlightenment.  This human existence, moreover, is not to be
achieved by force or mere chance; it is the result of positive actions.  And
because it is rare for beings to accomplish positive actions, a precious human
existence is indeed difficult to obtain.
  Nevertheless, we have now managed to be born into such a state; we have
encountered the Buddadharma, have entered the path and are now receiving
teachings.  But if we are unable to practise them, simply listening to the
teachings will not in itself liberate us from samsara, and will be of no help
to us when we are confronted by the hardships of birth, disease, old age and
death.  If we do not follow the doctor's prescription when we are sick, then
even if the doctor sits constantly by our side, the pain will not go away.

     Seven-Point Mind Training", translated by Padmakara Translation Group.

The realization of the nature of the mind is not something we can find by
searching for it from afar.  It is present within the essence of the mind
itself.  If we do not alter or change that in any way, that is enough.  It is
not as if we were lacking something before, so we need to make something new
through our meditation.  It is not as if we are bad and have to go through all
sorts of efforts to make ourselves good.  Goodness is something we all have.
It has always been with us, but we have just not looked for it or seen it yet,
so we have become confused.  Therefore all we need to do is to just rest
within it without changing it.  We see where it stays and rest there, so we
are like a kusulu.  This means that we rest free and easy with nothing to do,
very simply.  We do not need to think that we are making something good or
that we need to meditate properly.  It is enough just to know what we already
have.
  -- Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, from "Vivid Awareness", in "The Best Buddhist
     Writing 2012", edited by Melvin McLeod and the editors of the Shambhala

We all have to recognize the tremendous opportunity that we have.  As humans
we have this rare intelligence, but there is a real danger that we will waste
it.  Death is certain, but when we will die is totally unpredictable.  We
could lose our precious human existence at any moment.  With such reflections,
we must motivate ourselves to do something meaningful right now.  The best way
to make your human existence meaningful is to really engage in the practice of
Dharma.  During formal sitting meditation and in between sessions, in
different ways, be mindful and introspectively vigilant.  Keep constant watch
on your mind.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  In order to carry out a practice--such as constantly watching the mind--you
should form a determination, make a pledge, right when you wake up: "Now, for
the rest of this day, I will put into practice what I believe just as much as
I can."  It is very important that, at the start of the day, we should set out
to shape what will happen later.  Then, at the end of every day, check what
happened.  Review the day.  And if you carried through for that whole day your
morning's determination, then rejoice.  Reinforce further your motivation to
continue in the same line.  However, when you do your reviewing, you may
discover that you did things during the day that are contrary to your
religious values and beliefs.  You should then acknowledge this and cultivate
a deep sense of remorse.  Strengthen your resolve not to indulge in these
actions in the future.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  There are two different ways in which we can understand the term "ordinary
mind."  One way is to not take control over anything and end up following our
afflictions.  When a thought of anger arises, we follow it; when greed arises,
we lose control of ourselves to it.  Similarly, we lose control of ourselves
to our pride and jealousy.  Although we might think of this as our ordinary
state of mind, it is not what we mean here.  Here it does not mean losing
control of ourselves to negative emotions.  Instead, it means that we do not
need to do anything at all to the essence of the mind itself.
  We do not need to alter this essence in any way.  We do not have to worry
about what we are thinking, what is pleasant, or what is painful.  We can
leave this mind as it is.  If we try to alter the mind in any way, thoughts
will arise.  But if we do not do anything to it and let it rest easily, then
it is unaltered.  The Kagyu masters of the past called this the ordinary mind,
or the natural state.  They called it this out of their experience.  This
ordinary mind itself is the dharma expanse and the essence of the buddhas; it
is our buddha-nature.

  If your engagement with others is tainted by strong attachment, craving,
aversion, anger, and so forth, then that form of grasping is undesirable.  But
on the other hand, when you are interacting with other living beings and
become aware of their needs or suffering or pain, then you need to fully
engage with that and be compassionate.  So there can be positive attachment in
this sense of active engagement.
  Buddhist masters have long used the term attachment to describe the quality
of compassion for others.  For example, a verse from Haribhadra's Clear
Meaning Commentary refers to compassion that is attached to other living
beings.  And as we have seen, Nagarjuna teaches that attachment for other
living beings will arise spontaneously in the person who realizes emptiness.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
Kongtrul Rinpoche suggested we pray to the guru, buddhas, and bodhisattvas and
ask them to grant their blessings, "So I may give birth to the heart of
sadness."  But what is a "heart of sadness"?  Imagine one night you have
a dream.  Although it is a good dream, deep down you know that eventually you
will have to wake up and it will be over.  In life, too, sooner or later,
whatever the state of our relationships, or our health, our jobs and every
aspect of our lives, everything, absolutely everything, will change.  And the
little bell ringing in the back of your head to remind you of this
inevitability is what is called the "heart of sadness."  Life, you realise,
is a race against time, and you should never put off dharma practice until
next year, next month, or tomorrow, because the future may never happen.
  -- Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, from "Not for Happiness: A Guide to the So-
     Called Preliminary Practices"
~
  What we want to eliminate is grasping that is grounded upon falsification of
the object, distortions that arise as afflictions grasp at the apparent
substantial existence of an object.  Some texts say that mental states such as
compassion and faith are, by their very nature, virtuous and thus cannot at
the same time be afflicted mental states.  Yet there are other texts that
refer to "afflicted compassion" or "afflicted faith." For those of us
who have not realized emptiness, when we generate strong devotion toward the
Buddha perhaps there is within that faith, within that devotion, an element of
grasping at the Buddha as substantially real.  This makes it an instance of
so-called "afflicted devotion."
  Still, it is important to distinguish grasping rooted in falsification and
distortion from the attachment, focus, or holding that we associate with
compassion.  In our immediate experience, these two forms of grasping may seem
the same, but in terms of the overall mental environment they are quite
different.  Compassion is fact-based, while distorted grasping is not.

  By and large, human beings tend to prefer to fit in to society by following
accepted rules of etiquette and being gentle, polite, and respectful.  The
irony is that this is also how most people imagine a spiritual person should
behave.  When a so-called dharma practitioner is seen to behave badly, we
shake our heads over her audacity at presenting herself as a follower of the
Buddha.  Yet such judgments are better avoided, because to "fit in" is not
what a genuine dharma practitioner strives for.
  Think of Tilopa, for example.  He looked so outlandish that if he turned up
on your doorstep today, odds are you would refuse to let him in.  And you
would have a point.  He would most likely be almost completely naked; if you
were lucky, he might be sporting some kind of G-string; his hair would never
have been introduced to shampoo; and protruding from his mouth would quiver
the tail of a live fish.  What would your moral judgment be of such a being?
"Him!  A Buddhist?"  This is how our theistic, moralistic, and judgmental
minds work.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with morality, but the point of
spiritual practice, according to the vajrayana teachings, is to go beyond all
our concepts, including those of morality.
  -- Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, from "Not for Happiness: A Guide to the So-
     Called Preliminary Practices".

Because it is a reality that we are by nature social animals, bound to depend
on each other, we need to cultivate affection and concern for other people if
we really desire peace and happiness.  Look at wild animals and birds.  Even
they travel together, flock together, and help each other.  Bees do not have a
particular legal system, they do not follow any spiritual practice, but for
their livelihood and survival they depend on each other--that is their
natural way of existence.  Even though we intelligent human beings must also
depend on each other, we sometimes misuse our intelligence and try to exploit
each other.  That goes against human nature.  For those of us who profess to
believe in a particular religious practice, it is extremely important that we
try to help each other and cultivate a feeling of affection for each other.
That is the source of happiness in our life.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  It's important to differentiate a thought from an emotion.  We say things
such as, "I feel like they don't accept me." Actually, that is a thought.
We may feel hurt or frustrated, and it's because we're thinking that others
don't accept us.  How do we know they don't accept us?  We don't.  We
haven't asked them.  Instead, on the basis of how they looked at us or a
comment they made, our mind constructs a story that we believe.
  As soon as you hear yourself saying, "I feel like...," stop and recognize
that you can't "feel like" something.  You are thinking.  After you have
identified the thought, ask yourself, "Is that true?  How do I know it's true?
What evidence do I have to prove the validity of that thought?" It's really
startling to see how often we assume our interpretation of a situation is true
when in fact it is based on flimsy evidence.

     Wisdom and Compassion"

We are all human beings, and from this point of view, we are the same.  We all
want happiness and we do not want suffering.  If we consider this point, we
will find that there are no differences between people of different faiths,
races, colors, or cultures.  We all have this common wish for happiness.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama

Enlightenment is not anything new or something we create or bring into
existence.  It is simply discovering within us what is already there.  It is
the full realization of our intrinsic nature.  In Tibetan, buddha is sang
gyay.  Sang means that all of the faults have been cleared away, while gyay
means "full realization"; just as from darkness, the moon waxes, likewise
from ignorance, the qualities of the mind's intrinsic nature emerge.
  -- Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche
~
The fundamental teaching of the Buddha is that we should view others as being
more important than we are.  Of course, you cannot completely ignore yourself.
But neither can you neglect the welfare of other people and other sentient
beings, particularly when there is a clash of interest between your own
welfare and the welfare of other people.  At such a time you should consider
other people's welfare as more important than your own personal well-being.
Compare yourself to the rest of sentient beings.  All other sentient beings
are countless, while you are just one person.  Your suffering and happiness
may be very important, but it is just the suffering and happiness of one
individual, whereas the happiness and suffering of all other sentient beings
is immeasurable and countless.  So, it is the way of the wise to sacrifice one
for the benefit of the majority and it is the way of the foolish to sacrifice
the majority on behalf of just one single individual.  Even from the point of
view of your personal well-being, you must cultivate a compassionate
mind—that is that source of happiness in your life.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  Attachment and love are similar in that both of them draw us to the other
person.  But in fact, these two emotions are quite different.  When we're
attached we're drawn to someone because he or she meets our needs.  In
addition, there are lots of strings attached to our affection that we may or
may not realize are there.  For example, I 'love' you because you make me feel
good.  I 'love' you as long as you do things that I approve of.  I 'love' you
because you're mine.  You're my spouse or my child or my parent or my friend.
With attachment, we go up and down like a yo-yo, depending on how the other
person treats us.  We obsess, "What do they think of me?  Do they love me?
Have I offended them?  How can I become what they want me to be so that they
love me even more?" It's not very peaceful, is it?  We're definitely stirred
up.
  On the other hand, the love we're generating on the Dharma path is
unconditional.  We simply want other to have happiness and the causes of
happiness without any strings attached, without any expectations of what these
people will do for us or how good they'll make us feel.
  -- Thubten Chodron, "Don't Believe Everything You Think: Living with Wisdom
     and Compassion"

Because we don't recognize our essential nature--we don't realize that
although appearances arise unceasingly, nothing is really there--we invest
with solidity and reality the seeming truth of self, other, and actions
between self and others.  This intellectual obscuration gives rise to
attachment and aversion, followed by actions and reactions that create karma,
solidify into habit, and perpetuate the cycles of suffering.  This entire
process needs to be purified.
  -- Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche, from "In the Presence of Masters: Wisdom from 30
     Contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Teachers", edited by Reginald A. Ray.

  Effort is crucial in the beginning for generating a strong will.  We all
have the Buddha nature and thus already have within us the substances through
which, when we meet with the proper conditions, we can turn into a fully
enlightened being having all beneficial attributes and devoid of all faults.
The very root of failure in our lives is to think, "Oh, how useless and
powerless I am!" It is important to have a strong force of mind thinking,
"I can do it," this not being mixed with pride or any other afflictive
emotion.
  Moderate effort over a long period of time is important, no matter what you
are trying to do.  One brings failure on oneself by working extremely hard at
the beginning, attempting to do too much, and then giving it all up after a
short time.  A constant stream of moderate effort is needed.  Similarly, when
meditating, you need to be skillful by having frequent, short sessions; it is
more important that the session be of good quality than that it be long.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, from "Kindness, Clarity, and Insight"
~
We Buddhists are supposed to save all sentient beings, but practically
speaking, this may be too broad a notion for most people.  In any case, we
must at least think in terms of helping all human beings.  This is very
important.  Even if we cannot think in terms of sentient beings inhabiting
different worlds, we should nonetheless think in terms of the human beings on
our own planet.  To do this is to take a practical approach to the problem.
It is necessary to help others, not only in our prayers, but in our daily
lives.  If we find we cannot help another, the least we can do is to desist
from harming them.  We must not cheat others or lie to them.  We must be
honest human beings, sincere human beings.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  How things appear and how they actually exist differ greatly.  A person
engaging in practice of the perfection of wisdom does this kind of analysis
and then examines how things appear in ordinary experience, alternating
analysis and comparison with the usual mode of appearance in order to notice
the discrepancy between the actual mode of subsistence of phenomena and their
appearance.
  In this way the inherent existence which is the object of negation will
become clearer and clearer.  As much as the object of negation becomes
clearer, so much deeper will your understanding of emptiness become.  Finally,
you will ascertain a mere vacuity that is a negative of inherent existence.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
  Three attitudes prevent us from receiving a continual flow of blessings.
They are compared to three "pots": a full pot, a pot with poison in it,
and a pot with a hole in the bottom.
  The pot that's filled to the brim is like a mind full of opinions and
preconceptions.  We already know it all.  We have so many fixed ideas that
nothing new can affect us or cause us to question our assumptions.
  The pot containing poison is like a mind that's so cynical, critical, and
judgmental that everything is poisoned by this harshness.  It allows for no
openness and no willingness to explore the teachings or anything else that
challenges our righteous stance.
  The pot with a hole is like a distracted mind: our body is present but
we're lost in thought.  We're so busy thinking about our dream vacation or
what's for dinner that we're completely deaf to what's being said.
  Knowing how sad it is to receive blessings and not be able to benefit,
Shantideva wants to save himself grief by remaining open and attentive.
Nothing will improve, he says, unless we become more intelligent about cause
and effect.  This is a message worth considering seriously.
  -- Pema Chödrön, from "No Time to Lose: A Timely Guide to the Way of the
     Bodhisattva".
~
  Shantideva cites three benefits of pain.  First, it is valuable because
through sorrow, pride is driven out.  No matter how arrogant and condescending
we've been, great suffering can humble us.  The pain of a serious illness or
loss of a loved one can be transformative, softening us and making us less
self-centered.
  The second benefit of pain is empathy: the compassion felt for those who
wander in samsara.  Our personal suffering brings compassion for others in the
same situation.  A young woman was telling me that when her baby died, she
felt a deep connection to all the other parents who had lost children.  This
was, as she put it, the unexpected blessing of her sorrow.
  The third value of suffering is that evil is avoided and goodness seems
delightful.  When we practice according to Shantideva's instructions, we can
get smarter about cause and result.  Based on this understanding, we'll have
less inclination to cause harm, and more desire to gather virtue and benefit
others.
  -- Pema Chödrön, from "No Time to Lose: A Timely Guide to the Way of the
     Bodhisattva"
~
  Since emptiness, from between positive and negative phenomena, is a negative
phenomenon and, from between affirming negatives and non-affirming negatives,
is a non-affirming negative, when it appears to the mind, nothing will appear
except an absence of such inherent existence—a mere elimination of the
object of negation.  Thus, for the mind of a person realizing emptiness there
is no sense of, "I am ascertaining emptiness," and there is no thought,
"This is emptiness." If you had such a sense, emptiness would become
distant.  Nevertheless, the emptiness of inherent existence is ascertained and
realized.
  After such realization, even though whatever phenomena appear appear to
exist in their own right, you understand that they do not exist that way.  You
have a sense that they are like a magician's illusions in that there is a
combination of their appearing one way but actually existing another way.
Though they appear to exist inherently, you understand that they are empty of
inherent existence.
  When phenomena are seen this way, the conceptions that superimpose a sense
of goodness or badness on phenomena beyond what is actually there and serve as
a basis for generating desire and hatred lessen; this is because they are
based on the misconception that phenomena are established in their own right.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
      Rely on timeless awareness, which is free of elaboration, without
        identity, and the very essence of being;
      do not rely on ordinary consciousness, which is a mind fixated
        on characteristics and concepts.

  Timeless awareness entails (a) understanding that the way in which phenomena
actually abide is, from the ultimate perspective, free of all limitations
imposed by elaborations of origination, cessation, and so forth; (b)
realization of the nonexistence of the two kinds of identity; and (c) unerring
knowledge of sugatagarbha as utter lucidity, the way in which things actually
abide, beyond any context of speculative value judgments.  It is on this
awareness that one should rely.
  Ordinary consciousness entails (a) belief that what one immediately
perceives constitutes something truly existent; (b) conceptualization in terms
of characteristics, such as the sense of personal identity and the mind-body
aggregates; and (c) mental states that are conditioned, for example, by
attitudes of naively fixating on the pleasures of the senses.  One should not
rely on such consciousness.

  Such is the process of karma: it is ineluctable; its results are greatly
magnified; actions not committed have no effect; and the effects of actions
committed never expire on their own.
  Generally speaking, whether you are an ordinary mortal individual or a
spiritually advanced being, all positive experiences that carry with them any
pleasant sensation—down to even the slightest pleasure caused by a cool
breeze for beings reborn in a hell realm—occur due to positive karma
reinforced in the past; it is not in accord with the nature of things that
happiness be due to negative karma.  And all negative experiences that carry
with them any unpleasant sensation—down to even the slightest suffering that
could occur in the experience of an arhat—occur due to negative karma one
has reinforced in the past; for it is not in accord with the nature of things
that suffering be due to positive karma.

      "That which is seen and that which is touched are of a dream-like and
      illusion-like nature.  Because feeling arises together with the mind,
      it is not [ultimately] perceived." --Shantideva

  There is nothing whatever that has a true mode of existence.  Nevertheless,
this does not suggest that a person who experiences feelings and the feelings
themselves—pleasant and unpleasant—are utterly non-existent.  They do
exist, but in an untrue fashion.  Thus, the things that we see and touch have
a dream-like and illusion-like quality.
  In the second line the author refutes the true existence of the mind that
experiences feelings.  Since feelings arise in conjunction with the mind,
feelings are not perceived by the mind that is simultaneous with them.  There
must be a causal relationship between the experienced object and the
experiencing subject.  If two entities are substantially distinct and exist
simultaneously, there could be neither a causal relationship nor an identity
relationship between them.
  For this reason the author denies that either [intrinsic] relationship could
hold for the feelings and the awareness that is simultaneous with them.  Two
mental events that arise in conjunction with each other are not able to
apprehend one another.  This holds true for all states of awareness.  Thus,
feelings are not observed by the awareness that arises in conjunction with
them and that exists simultaneously with them.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama
~
Any happiness there is in the world ultimately turns to pain.  Why?  Consider
the two sides of a coin: just because what we desire is to be seen on the
front does not mean that dislike won't soon appear on the back.  Likewise,
hope and fear are a single coin, one entity with two faces--on the other side
of a moment in which we hope for more happiness will be our fear of more
suffering.  Until attachment is eliminated, we can be certain of having both
hope and fear.  As long as there is hope and fear, the delusions of samsara
will be perpetuated and there will be constant suffering.  Thus attachment is
the nature of both hope and fear: looking at the ultimate emptiness of the
self-envisioned magical illusion of hope and fear, we should hang loosely in
the flow.
  --Tulku Pema Rigtsal, "The Great Secret of Mind: Special Instructions on the
    Nonduality of Dzogchen", translated by Keith Dowman
~
  The feelings of joy and sorrow do not exist from their own side.  Although
they exist as conceptual imputations, you cling to them as existing from their
own side.  Feelings do not exist by their own intrinsic nature; rather, they
are identified on the basis of contributing circumstances.
  Therefore, this analysis is cultivated as an antidote for that [false
conception of intrinsic existence].  The meditative absorption that arises
from the field of discriminative investigation is the food of the
contemplative.—Shantideva
  Feelings do not truly exist; they are not found when sought through
analysis; they do not exist independently, but exist by the power of
convention.  Thus, the means for overcoming the misconception of the true
existence of feelings is meditation on their lack of such existence.  This
entails analyzing the mode of existence of feelings.
  Such investigation is an aid to meditative absorption and leads to the
integration of meditative quiescence and insight.  That increases the physical
vitality of the contemplative and enhances the power of his [or her] spiritual
practice.  Thus it is called the nourishment of the contemplative.
  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, "Transcendent Wisdom".

It is not enough merely to look into the space of happiness or sadness; it is
important to have pure presence constant in that flow.  If the power of
meditation is not constant, it is impossible to remain long in the place of
nondual perception.  Thoughts that arise intermittently will break the
continuity, and radiating out from this, like ripples on a pond, the poisonous
taste of emotion will arise to obstruct the meditation.  As gross thoughts
increase, ripples become rough waves that intensify the emotion.  Until subtle
emotions are left behind, we cannot eradicate suffering, so it is crucially
important to sustain the state of meditation.  When we gain strong familiarity
by staying in that space for a long time, then no matter what thoughts arise,
whether gross or subtle, they will not be able to dislodge us: upon
recognizing the first thought, whatever thought it may be, in that very
moment, we realize it to be the play of the spontaneous creativity of
dharmakaya.  Like a wave falling back into the ocean, the thought vanishes
into the dharmakaya.  In that space of naked empty pure presence that is the
view, always cherishing thoughts of the five poisonous emotions and all the
movements of body, speech, and mind, and the acts of eating, sleeping, moving,
and sitting, we are known as the yogins and yoginis who stand guard over the
shifting dharmakaya display.  This is the supreme method of sustaining the
essence of meditation.  According to Dzogchen teaching, this is unadulterated
by any kind of focus; it is called "the great meditation that is
nonmeditation."

    Nonduality of Dzogchen", translated by Keith Dowman.

       Who is more shameless in this world,
       Than one who abandons to samsara's ocean of suffering
       All the mothers who have tenderly cared for him since beginningless time
       And instead strives toward the peace of a solitary nirvana?
         --Shechen Gyaltsap Pema Namgyal

  In each of our lives since beginningless time, our mother carried us within
her body for nine months.  She took care of us when we were helpless babies;
she gave us food, education, and protection.  In return, we feel love and
gratitude for her kindness.
  Why not extend our respect and appreciation for our mother to everyone else?
If we take a broader perspective, we can consider that, within the countless
existences we have lived, every being has been our mother at one time or
another.  Don't they also deserve our kindness now?  We can extend the same
debt of gratitude that we owe our present mother to all sentient beings.  By
doing so, we naturally begin to develop a deep concern for the happiness of
others, and this feeling makes sense to us.
  We take the refuge vow not just for our own sake, but also for the sake of
all sentient beings.  This is bodhichitta, or the altruistic mind, which aims
for the enlightenment of all sentient beings.

      Direct perfect enlightenment [with regard to] all aspects,
      and abandonment of the stains along with their imprints
      [are called] buddha and nirvana respectively.
      In truth, these are not two different things.
        —Arya Maitreya

All aspects of the knowable—all absolute and relative phenomena—are
directly known.  Through this knowledge one is immediately and perfectly
enlightened.  This is the aspect of realization.  All the adventitious
defilements—the two veils along with their remaining imprints—are
abandoned without any exception.  This is the aspect of abandonment.  These
two qualities have been led to ultimate perfection.  They are therefore named
"perfect buddha" ["perfectly awakened and expanded"] from the
viewpoint of the former aspect, and "nirvana" ["gone beyond any torment
and pain"] from the viewpoint of the latter aspect.  These two aspects are
contained in one and the same meaning, the meaning of the tathagatagarbha,
whereas a difference only lies in the convention of the different terms.  In
the sense of the absolute field of experience of the noble ones' primordial
wisdom the qualities of realization and abandonment are therefore completely
inseparable and do not exist as two different things.
  -- Arya Maitreya, "Buddha Nature: The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra with
     Commentary", with commentary by Jamgön Kongtrül Lodro Thaye
~
  "Vehicle" (yana) has two meanings: the means by which one progresses and
the destination to which one is progressing.  Mahayana in the sense of the
vehicle by which one progresses means to be motivated by the mind of
enlightenment—wishing to attain highest enlightenment for the sake of all
sentient beings, one's objects of intent—and means to engage in the six
perfections.
  Seeing reason and need, Buddha set forth many systems and vehicles, but
these did not arise due to his being intimate with some and alien to others.
The trainees who were listening to his teaching had various dispositions,
interests, and abilities, and thus he taught methods that were suitable for
each of them.  For those who temporarily did not have the courage to strive
for Buddhahood or who did not at all have the capacity of obtaining Buddhahood
at that time, Buddha did not say, "You can attain Buddhahood."  Rather, he
set forth a path appropriate to the trainees' abilities.  Buddha spoke in
terms of their situation, and everything that he spoke was a means of
eventually attaining highest enlightenment even though he did not always say
that these were means for attaining Buddhahood.
  Since the purpose of a Buddha's coming is others' realization of the
wisdom of Buddhahood, the methods for actualizing this wisdom are one vehicle,
not two.  A Buddha does not lead beings by a vehicle that does not proceed to
Buddhahood; he establishes beings in his own level.  A variety of vehicles are
set forth in accordance with temporary needs.

You do not have to seek out loneliness--it is always there.  Egolessness is a
concept, a philosophy, but loneliness is a reality that you experience.  A
feeling of loneliness is part of the journey.  As for me, I feel that way
constantly, and I think it's a very healthy feeling, a very real feeling.
When you sense that you are not you anymore and that nothing can replace that
state, you begin to make discoveries.  You discover devotion, and you discover
a quality of richness and artistic expression that is very special.  Being
you, but not being you, is very resourceful.  You become a complete mountain
man: you know how to make fire and cook food.  But it doesn't mean anything.
You are still nobody.  That is the inspiration.

  Interdependence is our reality, whether we accept it or not.  In order to
live productively within such a reality, it is better to acknowledge and work
with interdependence, wholeheartedly and without resistance.  This is where
love and compassion come in.  It is love that leads us to embrace our
connectedness to others, and to participate willingly in the relations created
by our interdependence.  Love can melt away our defenses and our painful sense
of separation.  The warmth of friendship and love makes it easy for us to
accept that our happiness is intimately linked to that of others.  The more
widely we are able to love others, the happier and more content we can feel
within the relations of interdependence that are a natural part of our life.
  Love is possible in all our relationships because all people want happiness.
No one wants to suffer.  This is true of the people we love.  It is also true
of those we dislike.  We are all absolutely identical in this respect.  I
think this universal wish for happiness is something we can easily grasp
intellectually.  When we learn to also feel and respect this in our heart,
love naturally flourishes within us.
  -- The Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, "The Heart is Noble: Changing the World
     from the Inside Out"
~
  Day and night, night and day we spend our lives in the company of the
afflictions, generating desire for the pleasant and anger at the unpleasant,
and continue thus even when dreaming, unable to remain relaxed, our minds
completely and utterly mixed with thoughts of desire and hatred without
interruption.
  To what refuge should we go?  A source of refuge must have completely
overcome all defects forever; it must be free of all faults.  It must also
have all the attributes of altruism—those attainments which are necessary
for achieving others' welfare.  For it is doubtful that anyone lacking these
two prerequisites can bestow refuge; it would be like falling into a ditch and
asking another who is in it to help you out.  You need to ask someone who is
standing outside the ditch for help; it is senseless to ask another who is in
the same predicament.  A refuge capable of protecting from the frights of
manifold sufferings cannot also be bound in this suffering but must be free
and unflawed.  Furthermore, the complete attainments are necessary, for if you
have fallen into a ditch, it is useless to seek help from someone standing
outside it who does not wish to help or who wishes to help but has no means to
do so.
  Only a Buddha has extinguished all faults and gained all attainments.
Therefore, one should mentally go for refuge to a Buddha, praise him with
speech, and respect him physically.  One should enter the teaching of such a
being.

    All that is has me—universal creativity,
        pure and total presence—as its root.
    How things appear is my being.
    How things arise is my manifestation.
    Sounds and words heard are my messages
        expressed in sounds and words.
    All the capacities, forms, and pristine
        awareness of the buddhas;
    The bodies of sentient beings, their
        habituations, and so forth;
    All environments and their inhabitants,
        life forms, and experiences;
    Are the primordial state of pure and total
        presence.

    Without understanding me, the creativity of
        the universe,
    But investigating the phenomena that I
        manifest,
    You perceive everything dualistically due
        to your attachment and longing.
    Impermanent, apparitional things will fade
        away.
    They are aimless, like a blind man.

    All that is experienced and
    Your own mind are the unique primary reality.
    They cannot be conceptualized according to
        the cause and effect systems of thought.
    Investigate your mind's real nature
    So that your pure and total presence will
        actually shine forth.

  -- Longchenpa, "You Are the Eyes of the World"
~
  Devotion, or mögü in Tibetan, can be divided into two aspects: möpa and
küpa.  Möpa means "longing" or "wanting," and küpa means "humility,"
"respect," or "being without arrogance."  With küpa, you are not pretending
to be somebody who has reached a higher level of wisdom.  So in devotion,
longing and humbleness are put together.  That state of mind brings openness
to the teacher and to the dharma.
  With küpa, the longing of möpa does not become purely an emotional
indulgence or demand on the part of either the student or the teacher.  The
devotion of küpa is the respect or sacredness that comes from that experience
of aah [the space before first thought]!  Küpa arises because every highlight
in your life has always been touched by the sacredness of vajrayana, even
before you knew it.

     Volume Three: The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness"
~
All suffering in this life and others is created by the unsubdued mind.
Similarly, the basis of all the practices of the six paramitas, such as
generosity, moral discipline, and so on, is the mind.

Nothing is more important than guarding the mind.  Let us constantly keep
watch over the wild elephant of the mind, curbing it with mindfulness and
vigilance.  This is how to avoid being influenced by different external
conditions.  But even in retreat in a very secluded place, if the mind is not
kept under control, it will wander all over the place.  Even completely alone,
we can have an enormous amount of negative emotions.

How are we to guard the mind?  We should use attentiveness to watch our
thoughts and use mindfulness to judge whether we are acting correctly.  With
these two we have the means to annihilate all adverse conditions.  But without
them, we will not see whether our thoughts are positive or negative or whether
we are doing right or wrong, nor will we then be able to use antidotes as
necessary.

The great yogi Shabkar Tsogdruk Rangdrol replies to a Losar Day request from
his disciple Depa Wangpo on what to adopt and what to reject regarding
attitude and conduct...

    Don't harm your friends and neighbors; help them.
    Don't be stingy; use your wealth for offerings and charity.
    Don't let your body be idle; do prostrations and circumambulations.
    Don't let your mouth be idle; recite the mani mantra.
    Always have pure thoughts towards others.

    In brief, keeping Death in mind, practice the sacred Dharma.
    Give up doing wrong, and do what is wholesome.
    Whatever happiness and sufferings you undergo,
    Regard them as the result of previous actions.
    Always act in accord with the Dharma.
    Even though I may be far away,
    These instructions will remain like my very presence.
    Keep them in mind!

On the very night of Dodrupchen's death, his spiritual testament was
received by his principal disciple, Do Khyentse.  Dodrupchen appeared in the
sky in a radiant light body and an attire of lights.  He was floating on a
carpet of light, which was held up by four dakinis.  In a very enchanting
voice he sang the verses of his testament, which include the following lines:

    I am going into the expanse of the Wisdom of the Ultimate Sphere,
    Which is the state that transcends thoughts and expressions.
    I am going into the state of Mirrorlike Wisdom,
    Which is the ceaseless clear glow, fresh and open.
    I am going into the expanse of the Wisdom of Evenness,
    In which all the thoughts of grasping and grasper have vanished into the
        ultimate sphere.
    I am going into the Wisdom of Discriminative Awareness,
    Which is the clarity, the dawn of six kinds of foreknowledge.
    I am going into the state of the Wisdom of Accomplishment,
    Which emanates various manifestations in accordance with [the needs of]
        trainable beings.

    Son, please stay healthy.
    Now you have won over the obstructions of your life.
    Until all the phenomenal existents are liberated as the signs and
        teachings [of Dharma],
    [You should be] aware of samsara and nirvana as dreams and illusions.
    Dedicate yourself to the meditation where there is no reference point.
    This is the empowerment of total entrustment and aspiration.
    This is the supreme empowerment of empowerments.

  -- from "Masters of Meditation and Miracles", by Tulku Thondup.

  The view of interdependence makes for a great openness of mind.  In general,
instead of realizing that what we experience arises from a complicated network
of causes, we tend to attribute happiness or sadness, for example, to single,
individual sources.  But if this were so, as soon as we came into contact with
what we consider to be good, we would be automatically happy, and conversely,
in the case of bad things, invariably sad.  The causes of joy and sorrow would
be easy to identify and target.  It would all be very simple, and there would
be good reason for our anger and attachment.  When, on the other hand, we
consider that everything we experience results from a complex interplay of
causes and conditions, we find that there is no single thing to desire or
resent, and it is more difficult for the afflictions of attachment or anger to
arise.  In this way, the view of interdependence makes our minds more relaxed
and open.
  By training our minds and getting used to this view, we change our way of
seeing things, and as a result we gradually change our behavior and do less
harm to others.  As it says in the sutras:

      Abandon evildoing;
      Practice virtue well;
      Subdue your mind:
      This is the Buddha's teaching.

  -- H.H. the Dalai Lama, from "For the Benefit of All Beings"

In the avadhuti, the main path of enlightenment,
Prana and mind, bliss and warmth, are united,
Becoming unconditioned great bliss.
The wisdom of unobscured insight dawns.

"This is unsurpassable," the guru has said.
The darkness of ignorance is purified in space.
One is free from the two obscurations of grasping and fixation.
Therefore bliss and luminosity dawn in simplicity.

This appearance of collective coincidence
Is a reflection without self-nature.
All appearances are realized like that,
And just like appearances in a dream,
All dharmas arise as illusions...

When thoughts arise, rest naturally.
When dreaming, be mindful without corrupting it.
When in the pardo, don't control, but be aware.
When there is fruition, let it arise without obscuration.

  When you pass away, nothing will do you any good except for the pure Dharma.
You will not simply disappear when you die.  Rather, what happens next will be
dictated by your previous actions.
  For these reasons, you should exert yourself by whatever means necessary to
free yourself from samsara, which is nothing but a vast ocean of suffering!
Practice your teacher's guidance concerning what to do and what to give up
to the letter, without falling under the influence of immature friends or bad
influences.  To the best of your ability, incorporate this genuine teaching on
the certainty of death into each and every day.
  Keeping all this in mind, arouse faith in the Three Jewels so that you will
be able to practice in this manner, thinking to yourself, "Think of me,
Three Jewels!" At the same time, be sure to generate an intense sense of
renunciation and subdue your mind stream.

I would like to mention my visit to Lourdes as a pilgrim.  There, in front of
the cave, I experienced something very special.  I felt a spiritual vibration,
a kind of spiritual presence there.  And then, in front of the image of the
Virgin Mary, I prayed.  I expressed my admiration for this holy place that has
long been a source of inspiration and strength, that has provided spiritual
solace, comfort and healing to millions of people.  And I prayed that this may
continue for a long time to come.  My prayer there was not directed to any
clearly defined object, like Buddha or Jesus Christ or a bodhisattva, but was
simply directed to all great beings who have infinite compassion towards all
sentient beings.

The Buddhist teaching is superior in four ways: view, meditation, behavior,
and fruit.

1.  The "four seals" that distinguish the [Buddhist] view are as follows: all
composed phenomena are impermanent, all contaminated things are miserable, all
phenomena are selfless, and nirvana is peace.

2.  Buddhist meditation serves as an antidote to all cyclic existence within
the three realms.

3.  Buddhist behavior is free from the two extremes, having abandoned both the
extreme of overindulgence of desire, which is a case of being desirous and
wanting good and great quantities of food and clothing, and the extreme of
being too tired and worn out in body and mind.

4.  The fruits are the true cessations, which are abandonments such that the
obstruction that is removed does not arise again [and which comes about]
through analyzing individually the nonexistence of the referent object of the
conception of self.

These four [view, meditation, behavior, and fruit] are the distinguishing
features of Buddhist doctrine.

When you are busy and preoccupied, you feel hassled by your own existence.
You are so busy that you think that you do not have any time to spare for your
practice.  Such torment and busyness seem to be monumental or historic, but
that is not the case.  As far as we are concerned, that kind of torment is
absolutely ordinary.  As you begin to work on that, you realize that the
inconvenience, discomfort, and anguish that you experience is no more than
anybody else experiences.  So your experience is no longer regarded as
monumental—no more than if you step on a cat's tail, and the cat cries
out, "Wooaaaoow!"  However, it is still a problematic situation.  Therefore
you need to practice the paramita of discipline, which overcomes that type of
preoccupation altogether.  You begin to realize that preoccupations are
garbage; they are worth flushing out so that something real could come up.
Then paramita activity begins to make sense, and you begin to act in a more
genuine way.

If we unbalance nature, humankind will suffer.  Furthermore, we must consider
future generations: a clean environment is a human right like any other.  It
is therefore part of our responsibility toward others to ensure that the world
we pass on is as healthy as, if not healthier than, we found it.  This is not
quite such a difficult proposition as it might sound.  For although there is a
limit to what we as individuals can do, there is no limit to what a universal
response might achieve.  It is up to us as individuals to do what we can,
however little that may be.  Just because switching off the light on leaving
the room seems inconsequential, it does not mean we shouldn't do it.

Basically we are trying to put a stop to frivolity of any kind.  Frivolity is
an interesting word.  It can mean being crazy and indulging unnecessarily in a
very crude fashion, but it could also mean indulging in something in the name
of humor and overdoing it slightly.  If you are embarrassed to deal with a
particular subject, you find another subject to discuss.  If you are tired of
drinking vodka, you switch to sake.  If you are bored with talking to one
person, you switch to somebody else.  Frivolity is anything that creates
further confusion, or the longing for further confusion.  Confusion may seem
luxurious: when you no longer have it, you begin to miss that confusion, and
you would like to re-create it.  It is like going back to an adult bookshop
and getting more magazines.  But with discipline, you control any form of
potential escape from reality.

  The essence of all the songs can be epitomized by the four dharmas of
Gampopa.  These are: (1) one’s mind becomes dharmic; (2) that dharma
practice becomes path; (3) in following that path, confusion is removed; (4)
having removed confusion, everything dawns as wisdom.
  The first dharma is the ground, where our mind becomes dharmic so that we
and the dharma are no longer separate entities.  We develop true renunciation
and have a sense of revulsion towards samsara.  The second dharma is the path.
When our mind goes along with the dharma, the dharma becomes the path, and any
obstacles, whether extreme or ordinary, become a part of our journey.  The
third dharma is the fruition.  As the journey is taking place, the process of
the journey liberates us from confusion and anxiety.  We are delighted by our
journey and we feel it is good.  The fourth dharma is the total vision.  When
we are able to overcome confusion and anxiety, even our anxiety is not
regarded as anti-dharma or anti-path.  Cosmic wakefulness takes place.

Scrutinize Apperances

No matter what our mind makes appear as an object of one of our six
collections of consciousness—sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile or
bodily sensations, or mental objects or events—we thoroughly scrutinize its
mode of appearance.  Our mind is making it appear as though its existence were
established by virtue of itself, empowered by some truly and inherently
existent self-nature—and not by virtue simply of mental labeling
establishing its existence as what can be labeled "this" or "that"
from this side.  We thoroughly scrutinize this mode of appearance and the mode
of existence it implies.  There does appear to be something solidly there, not
existing as what it is by virtue simply of mental labeling, but by virtue of
itself, independently of anything else.  But, by reminding ourselves that it
does not exist as it appears to exist—by being mindful that its existence
and identity are not established through its own power—we automatically
reconfirm and become even stronger in our conviction in its bare mode of
existence.  In other words, as the text [the First Panchen Lama’s A Root
Text for the Precious Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra] says, "[You
experience] their bare mode of existence dawning in an exposed, resplendent
manner."
