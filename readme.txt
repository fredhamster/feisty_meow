This is the "feisty meow concerns" codebase top folder.

Feisty Meow Concerns codebase comprises some but probably not all of several projects that
have come before.  These include the Twain.COM library scripts, the Yeti / YetiCode library
scripts, the HOOPLE 1 and HOOPLE 2 C++ Codebases, the Fred Huffhines opensource LSL scripts,
the CLAM build system, and a variety of other efforts.
