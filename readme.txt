Quick Start Guide for the Feisty Meow Codebase

Commands that can be typed in a console or terminal are are prefixed with "$".
(Do not include the dollar sign when copying and pasting commands.)
Information that varies by platform is prefixed with a '|' character.

This documentation assumes that the code is stored in the default location:
  /opt/feistymeow.org/feistymeow
If you have stored it elsewhere, then please adapt the commands accordingly.

==============

How to get the feisty meow codebase

| On Microsoft Windows, install the Cygwin tools as documented here:
| /opt/feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/documentation/cygwin_install_list.txt (local file) or
| https://feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/documentation/cygwin_install_list.txt (web)

Retrieve a clone of the feisty meow codebase:
$ git clone git://feistymeow.org/feisty_meow

==============

How to load the feisty meow script environment

Set up the feisty_meow scripts; this is only needed once, when you first get
the codebase.
$ bash /opt/feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/scripts/core/reconfigure_feisty_meow.sh

Connect the feisty meow scripts to your login script (in ~/.bashrc).
Note that this actually modifies ~/.bashrc.  This step is only needed once.
$ bash /opt/feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/scripts/core/connect_feisty_meow.sh

| For the root user, you can pass a flag '--root' to the connect_feisty_meow
| script.  This will add an alias for 'feistyme' which loads the feisty meow
| scripts on demand (instead of automatically upon login).

Load the script environment into the current shell.  This can be done for
any new shell.  This is idempotent, so it does no harm to run it again.
Note that you should not need this step if you connected feisty meow to
~/.bashrc above.
$ source /opt/feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/scripts/core/launch_feisty_meow.sh

When the feisty meow script environment loaded, many new aliases and
functions are available for use.  These come from the $FEISTY_MEOW_SCRIPTS
folder.
There is a list of feisty meow script commands available at:
https://feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/documentation/feisty_meow_command_reference.txt

==============

How to install the feisty meow script dependencies

A couple of perl modules are required by some of the scripts (including the
differ utility and the feisty meow customization system).  They can be
installed with either apt-get or CPAN.

Install using apt-get (on Ubuntu or Debian-based OS):
$ sudo apt-get install libfile-which-perl libtext-diff-perl

or Install using perl's CPAN:
$ sudo cpan install Text::Diff File::Which

or on Cygwin (MS-Windows), install with apt-cyg:
$ apt-cyg install perl-File-Which perl-Text-Diff

==============

How to update the feisty meow codebase to the latest online version

This assumes that a somewhat current version of feisty meow is already
installed and the scripts are loaded (see above section for how to load).

The command below retrieves the latest version of feisty meow codebase
from the online repository and regenerates the scripts.

$ rpuffer $FEISTY_MEOW_APEX ; regenerate

==============
