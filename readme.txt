Quick Start Guide for the Feisty Meow Codebase

Commands that you should enter into your terminal are prefixed with "=>" and
conditional portions are prefixed with a '|' character.

==============
How to get the feisty meow codebase

| On Microsoft Windows, install the Cygwin tools as documented here:
| ~/feisty_meow/documentation/cygwin_install_list.txt (local file) or
| https://feistymeow.org/feisty_meow/documentation/cygwin_install_list.txt (web)

Retrieve a clone of the feisty meow code:
=> git clone git://feistymeow.org/feisty_meow

The remainder of these notes assume that the code is stored in
~/feisty_meow (aka $HOME/feisty_meow).

==============
How to load the feisty meow script environment

Set up the feisty_meow scripts; this is only needed once, when you first get
the codebase.  It can also regenerate the scripts using the latest version.
=> bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/core/reconfigure_feisty_meow.sh

Load the script environment into the current shell.
=> source ~/feisty_meow/scripts/core/launch_feisty_meow.sh

With the feisty meow script environment loaded, several aliases are now
available for building the codebase and they are used in the sections below.

Closing the current shell will lose the feisty meow environment.  Loading the
environment can be made automatic by adding the 'source' line above to the
shell's startup file.  Example startup files are available in:
~/feisty_meow/feisty_inits

==============
How to install the feisty meow script dependencies

A couple of perl modules are required by some of the scripts (including the
differ utility and the feisty meow customization system).  They can be
installed with either apt-get or CPAN.

Install using apt-get:
=> sudo apt-get install libfile-which-perl libtext-diff-perl

or Install using perl's CPAN:
=> sudo cpan install Text::Diff File::Which

==============
How to install the build dependencies for feisty meow

| Ubuntu / Debian:
| => sudo apt-get install build-essential librtmp-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libssl-dev

| Centos / Redhat / Fedora:
| => sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ openssl-devel.x86_64 curl-devel

| Microsoft Windows:
| Download and install the Cygwin environment first from cygwin.com, which is
| documented in ~/feisty_meow/documentation/cygwin_install_list.txt

==============
How to build the feisty meow codebase

Run the following command to build the feisty meow libraries and applications.
=> bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/generator/produce_feisty_meow.sh

After the build is complete, the feisty meow applications can be found in
$FEISTY_MEOW_BINARIES (environment variable).
=> ls $FEISTY_MEOW_BINARIES 

==============
How to clean up the files generated by the build

This command cleans out all the generated files:
=> bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/generator/whack_build.sh clean

==============
What are the feisty meow dependencies?

The feisty meow scripts depend on these scripting languages and tools:
  bash
  perl (including Text::Diff and File::Which)
  python
  gnumake

The feisty meow libraries and applications depend on these tools:
  Gnu C++
  RTMP streams (?still?  not sure.)
  Curl
  Open SSL
