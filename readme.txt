This is the "feisty meow (TM) concerns" codebase top folder.

Feisty Meow (TM) Concerns codebase comprises some but probably not all of several projects that
have come before.  These include the Twain.COM library scripts, the Yeti / YetiCode library
scripts, the HOOPLE 1 and HOOPLE 2 C++ Codebases, the Fred Huffhines opensource LSL scripts,
the CLAM build system, and a variety of other efforts.

Directories and files of interest here...

nucleus/
    Source for the basic modules of the Feisty Meow (TM) codebase.  This includes basic
    data structures, useful utilities, and the like.

huffware/
    The library of LSL scripts for osgrid and Second Life written by the avatar named Fred
    Huffhines.  Fred Huffhines is a regular contributor and a well-loved member of our
    development team.  He also happens to be a fictional sock-puppet for adventuring around
    the grids, but a lot of code has been written in his name.  We are going to release the
    full corpus of the Huffhines work over time.

kona/
    Our burgeoning Java libraries.  Not much to see here yet, but there is some code piling
    up for these that we will try to release soon.

octopi/
    Octopus design pattern and CROMP protocol reference implementations.  Assorted applications
    based on these.

production/
    Machinery for getting releases out the door, including the generated files such as binaries
    and build system tools.

    languages, such as bash and perl.
