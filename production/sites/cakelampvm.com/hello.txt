Welcome to the CakePHP LAMP VM.

Please refer to the built-in documentation available at: http://cakelampvm.com

Some first steps to make this vm your own:

####

1) change your password for the developer account.
(may eventually be automatically required)

####

2) change your git configuration for user and email.  this is how we've
configured it so far:

  # git config --global user.email "developer@cakelampvm.com"
  # git config --global user.name "Developer J. Cakemo"

if you're developing on a real project, you probably don't want the bogus
email and even more bogus name above attached to your commits.
Just run the two commands again but with proper values.
