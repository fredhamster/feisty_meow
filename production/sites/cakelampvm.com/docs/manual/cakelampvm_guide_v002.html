    <p>The cakelampvm project provides a virtualbox VM that acts as an "internet
      in a bottle".&nbsp; The virtual machine provides DNS services (<a title="dns server"
        href="http://www.bind9.net/">bind9</a>), a Web server (<a title="patchy"
        href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache2</a>), a full <a title="ubuntu means compassion and humanity"

    <h2>Powering up with the Feisty Meow® scripts</h2>
    <p>[First, let me drop the registered trademark symbol from here on
      in.&nbsp; I hope its presence above has been sufficiently clear for legal
      purposes, but now it will just get in the way.&nbsp; Also, capitalization
      really bores me, and it's the feisty meow codebase anyhow, so that's how
      it will be written henceforth.]</p>
    <p>The feisty meow scripts are a cohesive bash scripting environment for
      getting a variety of tasks done.&nbsp; The scripts recently incorporated
      the 'avbash' collection from Saco Designs, which provides tools for
      bringing up CakePHP web sites and managing the collection of repositories
      for those sites.&nbsp; Each website is considered an "application", and
      the application name itself (e.g. "winterportlibrary") can often provide
      all the details for "powering up" the site.&nbsp; The feisty meow team has
      added additional scripts for managing DNS domains and Apache websites that
      provide the capability to "stand up" an entire website around an
      application, with accompanying domain.</p>
    <p>The scripts for now are documented separately within the Feisty Meow
      codebase.&nbsp; The Feisty Meow readme file provides some valuable
      information on configuring the codebase.&nbsp; If you have the cakelampvm,
      then this has already been done for you on the vm in the developer account.&nbsp;
      The script documentation is available in the UHHHHHH page of something..</p>
    <h2>How to set up virtualbox for your host PC</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download and install virtualbox:
        https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</li>
      <li>Install the extension pack for virtualbox: This provides USB drivers
        and other features.&nbsp; This is installed on virtualbox itself, not on
        the guests.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the extension pack at
          https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</li>
        <li>Stop any running virtualbox vms.</li>
        <li>Close virtualbox control panel.</li>
        <li>Double-click on the downloaded extensions package (in a file
          explorer) and virtualbox should install it.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Run the virtualbox control panel.</li>
      <li>Download the cakelampvm guest vm package and unzip it.&nbsp; Store the
        unzipped version in some appropriate place where you want the virtual
        machine to reside on your host's hard drive.</li>
      <li>Add the guest VM to your list of VMs.&nbsp; From the virtualbox menus,
        choose the "Machine" menu and select "Add".&nbsp; Point the selector
        dialog at the cakelampvm folder you created above and open the
        cakelampvm.vbox file.</li>
      <li>Now the cakelampvm should show up in the list of virtual
        machines.&nbsp; Before starting it, perform the following network
        configuration sections.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Configure the Host-Only network on virtualbox</h3>
    <p>Configuring host-only networking for the VM makes the VM completely local
      to your machine.&nbsp; The cakelampvm will not be accessible on the
      internet or from the LAN, and can only be accessed by your host PC.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Go to virtual box "Preferences" (global preferences, not for a
        specific vm).</li>
      <li> Click on the "Network" tab.</li>
      <li> Choose the "Host-only Networks" tab from within "Network".</li>
      <li> Click the plus icon to add a new host-only network, or if there is
        already a Host-only network, then edit it.</li>
      <li>Set the "Adapter" parameters:<br>
        IPv4 Address: 10.28.42.1<br>
        IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0<br>
        IPv6 Address: (leave blank)<br>
        IPv6 Prefix Length: 0<br>
        Virtualbox will fill in the other details like so:<br>
        <p><img alt="host only network adapter" src="images/host_only_network_adapter.png"></p>
      </li>
      <li>Set the "DHCP Server Settings" to disabled, e.g.<br>
        <img alt="host only dhcp" src="images/host_only_adapter_dhcp_server.png"><br>
        This is disabled because we will be using statically assigned addresses
        for convenience and stability.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional information on host-only (and other) network adapter types is
      at: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_nat_service<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Configure the Nat Network on virtualbox</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Go to virtual box "Preferences" (global preferences, not for a
        specific vm).</li>
      <li> Click on the "Network" tab.</li>
      <li> Choose the "Nat Networks" tab from within "Network".</li>
      <li> Click the plus icon to add a new host-only network.</li>
      <li>Set the "NAT Network Details" parameters:<br>
        Network Name: NatNetwork<br>
        Network CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24<br>
        Supports DHCP: checked<br>
        Supports IPv6: optionally checked<br>
        These are my settings, with IPv6 left disabled:<br>
        <img alt="nat net config" src="images/nat_network_config.png"></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Start up the VM</h2>
    <p>Using the virtualbox interface, you should now be able to start your
      virtual machine.&nbsp; Virtualbox will complain if it detects any
      remaining configuration problems in the VM, but it should start
      normally.&nbsp; The Linux boot sequence will show many lines of text,
      before bringing up a black console window with a login dialog.</p>
    <p>You can log in directly on the VM console with the developer account, but
      it is generally more useful to connect to the cakelampvm over ssh.&nbsp;
      If the networking has been established properly, you should be able to do
      this with:</p>
    <pre>ssh developer@cakelampvm.com&nbsp; (or equivalent with your ssh client)</pre>
    <p>And then provide the password to log in.</p>
    <p>A feature called "X forwarding" is enabled, so if you start graphical
      applications on the VM, you can display them from an appropriately
      configured host.&nbsp; (If you're running Linux as the host for the VM,
      you can definitely run remote windows.&nbsp; Windows may not support
      that.)</p>
    <p>#### check this!!!</p>
    <h2>Using the guest VM's DNS services</h2>
    <p>The cakelampvm has been set up to provide a DNS server which will answer
      name requests for all of the sites that the VM hosts.</p>
    <p>To use the cakelampvm DNS, modify your host operating system network
      configuration by adding or changing the DNS server to use the guest VM's
      DNS service.&nbsp; This is available at the local address
      10.28.42.20.&nbsp; The DNS server can be tested with nslookup, dig and
      other tools.</p>
    <p>Note that the cakelampvm DNS should be listed first, if one intends to
      override any DNS names that actually exist out on the internet.</p>
    <p>If the DNS server is properly set up, then these ping commands should get
      answering responses:</p>
    <pre>ping cakelampvm.com</pre>
    <pre>ping defaultcake.cakelampvm.com</pre>
    <pre>ping mapsdemo.cakelampvm.com</pre>
    <h3>Setting up DNS on Windows</h3>
    <p>The ipconfig tool will provide helpful information about your current
      networking and DNS configuration:</p>
    <pre>ipconfig --all</pre>
    <p>The DNS configuration on Windows is somewhat byzantine.&nbsp; The pipe
      characters ('|') below are used to separate the menus or tabs or dialogs
      to traverse.&nbsp; Follow this path to get to the DNS config:</p>
    <pre>Control Panel | Network &amp; Sharing | click WiFI or Ethernet link near top right | click Adapter Settings on left | click on specific network device to modify | select Properties</pre>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Editing files on the guest VM from the host</h2>
    <p>On the host computer, look for the guest vm as a networked computer
      called cakelampvm.&nbsp; This should provide some network shares using
      Microsoft SMB protocol, and they can be attached to using the "developer"
      user and its password.</p>
    <p>On windows, one may want to mount this network location as a drive letter
      for easier access.</p>
    <p>Currently, the root of all web servers is exposed as "www".&nbsp; Editing
      the files in those folders requires ownership by the developer user.&nbsp;
      Currently the defaultcake server is owned by developer.</p>
    <p>One should be able to create a new directory in the www folder owned by
      the developer user over the network also, which can be used for creating
      new projects.&nbsp; However, there is a config issue in the current vm
      (v001) about this; to fix, run this command on the guest vm as the
      developer user:</p>
    <pre>sudo chmod g+w /var/www</pre>
    <p>Afterwards, the www folder should allow the developer user to create new
      folders at will.</p>
    <h2>Accessing files on the host PC from the guest VM</h2>
    <p>If you want to share a folder from the host to the guest, perhaps for
      driver updates or other conveniences, then make the share with these
      steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a folder on the host that is to be shared.</li>
      <li>Right-click on the vm in virtualbox manager and choose "Settings".</li>
      <li>In the "Shared Folders" tab of the settings, go to "Machine Folders".</li>
      <li>Click the folder plus icon to create a new share.</li>
      <li>Fill in the "Folder Path" on the host PC to the folder that will be
        shared, and give it a name for the guest.&nbsp; We assume the folder
        name will be "myshare".</li>
      <li>On the guest vm, run the following commands to mount the share:<br>
        <pre>mkdir ~/shared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # for the guest's version of the shared folder</pre>
        <pre>sudo mount -t vboxsf myshare ~/shared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # mount the vm's share name onto the folder on the vm.</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Adding a new website and domain on the guest VM</h2>
    <p>To add a new website, you will need to pick one of the DNS options below
      (A or B) depending on how you want to name the site.&nbsp; After the DNS
      is updated, then follow the section after for creating a new apache conf
      file.</p>
    <p>Assuming one has created a new folder in "www" called "greatsite", then
      the new web site can be brought online on the vm with one of the following
      options.</p>
    <h3>DNS Option A: Using a sub-domain in the cakelampvm.com domain</h3>
    Connect to the cakelampvm via ssh as the developer user, e.g.: ssh
    developer@cakelampvm.com
    <p>Execute the following command to edit the DNS file for the cakelampvm
      domain:</p>
    <pre>sudo vi /etc/bind/cakelampvm.com.conf</pre>
    <p>Add a stanza for the new site at the end of this file:</p>
    <pre>greatsite.cakelampvm.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.28.42.20<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN HINFO "linux server" "ubuntu"</pre>
    <p>Restart the DNS server: sudo service bind9 restart</p>
    <p>Afterwards, pinging greatsite.cakelampvm.com should work from either the
      guest or the host.</p>
    <h3>DNS Option B: Using an entirely new domain for the site</h3>
    <p>Similar procedure to above, but we will create a new file for the new
      domain and add it to the bind directory.&nbsp; For this example, we will
      create a file called /etc/bind/greatsite.tv.conf for our new domain
      greatsite.tv with these contents:</p>
    <pre>$TTL 1W<br>@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN SOA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fred.cakelampvm.com. (<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017100801&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; serial<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; refresh<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; retry<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; expiry<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6H )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; minimum<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN NS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ns.cakelampvm.com.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN MX&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mail.cakelampvm.com.<br><br># main domain for machine.<br>greatsite.tv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.28.42.20<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IN HINFO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "linux server" "ubuntu"</pre>
    The gnarly prefix stuff above the "greatsite.tv." listing establishes
    configuration info for the new domain.&nbsp; This file relies on the
    existing cakelampvm.com infrastructure in DNS, such as the "ns" host, which
    is the domain's name server.
    <p>Now that the config file is in place, edit "named.conf.local" to add the
      new file by adding this bit of configuration at the end:</p>
    <pre>zone "greatsite.tv" in {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file "/etc/bind/greatsite.tv.conf";<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type master;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allow-query { any; };<br>};</pre>
    <p>Restart the DNS server: sudo service bind9 restart</p>
    <p>Afterwards, pinging greatsite.tv should work from either the guest or the
      host.</p>
    <h3>Create a new apache configuration file and load it</h3>
    <p>Start with the following template file for the new website, and modify it
      for the appropriate host name:</p>
    <pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ServerName greatsite.cakelampvm.com<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ServerAlias greatsite.cakelampvm.com *.greatsite.cakelampvm.com<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DocumentRoot /var/www/greatsite<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/greatsite.cakelampvm.com-error.log<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/greatsite.cakelampvm.com-access.log combined<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alias /statistics "/var/www/webwork.repository/webwork/maps_demo/webroot/statistics"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include /etc/apache2/conf-library/basic-options.conf<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include /etc/apache2/conf-library/rewrite-enabling.conf<br>&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
    <p>The above example is pre-modified for DNS Option A above, the
      greatsite.cakelampvm.com name.&nbsp; Switching all of those to
      "greatsite.tv" instead would support DNS option B.</p>
    <p>Copy that file into /etc/apache/available-sites under an appropriate
      name, which here we will call "greatsite.conf".</p>
    <p>Tell apache to use the new file:</p>
    <pre>a2ensite greatsite.conf</pre>
    <p>Finally, restart apache to get it to begin serving the site:</p>
    <pre>sudo service apache2 restart</pre>
    <h3>Test the new web site</h3>
    <p>Given the configuration above, your host PC should now be able to access
      the new website.</p>
    <p>To test this, first try pinging the hostname, e.g.: ping
      greatsite.cakelampvm.com or ping greatsite.tv</p>
    <p>Then, if there are responses to the ping, it means the DNS is
      working.&nbsp; If there are no responses, check the instructions in the
      above DNS option section.</p>
    <p>Once the DNS is working, one can try browsing to the site at:
      http://greatsite.cakelampvm.com or http://greatsite.tv (depending on the
      DNS option chosen).</p>
    <p>If the site is not showing up properly, try examining the apache logs for
      error messages that can be corrected.&nbsp; The log files are stored in
      /var/log/apache2 and are generally named after the website.</p>
    <h2>Configuring the guest VM</h2>
    <p>The guest VM should already be set up appropriately.&nbsp; These steps
      are provided for reference and updates.</p>
    <h3>Set up virtualbox guest additions for the VM</h3>
    <p>** note for v001 of cakelampvm: the below steps are still needed on the
      shipped image.</p>
    <p>This procedure is needed if the guest provides an older or incompatible
      version of the guest additions (which have already been installed on the
      guest vm).&nbsp; It may also be necessary when a new version of the guest
      additions becomes available.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To install the guest additions, open the guest VM and have its window
        in focus.</li>
      <li>Choose the "Devices" menu and select "Insert Guest Additions CD
        Image".&nbsp; This will mount the CD's ISO image on the VM.</li>
      <li>On the guest VM, it may be necessary to mount the CD image that's now
        available:<br>
        sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom</li>
      <li>Since the VM currently has no windowing system installed, one must
        start the Guest Additions install manually:<br>
        cd /media/cdrom<br>
        sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</li>
      <li>This should install the guest additions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Set up network adapters on guest VM</h3>
    <p>The network interfaces should already be configured on the guest within
      the virtualbox configuration.&nbsp; This is available by clicking on the
      VM in the virtualbox manager and selecting "Settings".&nbsp; These are the
      configuration settings used:</p>
    Adapter 1:<br>
    &nbsp; Attached to: Host-only Adapter<br>
    &nbsp; Name: vboxnet0&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Adapter 2:<br>
      &nbsp; Attached to: Nat Network<br>
      &nbsp; Name: NatNetwork</p>
    <p>On the guest VM itself, the network settings are specified in a file
      called /etc/network/interfaces.&nbsp; Here are the current contents of
      that file:</p>
    <pre>source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*<br><br>auto lo<br>iface lo inet loopback<br><br>auto enp0s3<br>iface enp0s3 inet static<br>&nbsp; address 10.28.42.20<br>&nbsp; netmask 255.255.255.0<br>&nbsp; network 10.28.42.0<br>&nbsp; broadcast 10.28.42.255<br>&nbsp; dns-domain cakelampvm.com<br>&nbsp; dns-search cakelampvm.com<br>&nbsp; dns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 8.8.8.8</pre>
    <pre>auto enp0s8</pre>
    <pre>iface enp0s8 inet dhcp</pre>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Handy Techniques</h2>
    <h3>Get the network address on the guest vm</h3>
    <p>Run this command: ifconfig</p>
    <p>In the results, look for "inet addr".&nbsp; There may be more than one,
      if there are multiple network interfaces.</p>
    <h3>How to cleanly reboot or shut down the guest VM</h3>
    <p>When you've got the DNS and everything integrated, these commands will
      manage the vm's state:</p>
    <p>First, log into the guest VM: ssh developer@cakelampvm.com</p>
    <p>Then, reboot the guest VM: sudo reboot</p>
    <p>Or, halt the guest VM: sudo shutdown -h now</p>
    <p>Using these commands is better than just cycling the power from the
      virtualbox control panel.</p>
    <h2>Notes on building the Cake Lamp VM</h2>
    <p>This is all work that should already have been done.&nbsp; It is
      mentioned here just as breadcrumbs for a future vm builder.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Downloaded and installed virtualbox for host computer (where the vm
        image will be built).</li>
      <li>Downloaded ubuntu server 16.04 iso.
        (https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)</li>
      <li>Created a new vm in virtualbox, telling it to start from the ubuntu
        server iso.</li>
      <li>Installed LAMP stack on guest VM.&nbsp; Some help here:
