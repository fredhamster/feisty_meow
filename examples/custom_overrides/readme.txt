this folder has some examples of how various people (or one person right now)
do their custom scripts.

the folder can have alias files (ending in .alias) that are written in bash,
and it can also have shell scripts that are sourced into the main-line of
script initialization (any files ending in .sh).

when you have some custom scripts you want to use, copy them from your own
folder to the $FEISTY_MEOW_GENERATED/custom directory.
