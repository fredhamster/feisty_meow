This is the feisty meow examples folder.  It has the following folders...

bashisms/
  A few examples of techniques in bash.  Handy to keep track of these.

custom_overrides/
  Some personal scripts that can be added to the base set, basically serving
  as useful examples and also as a place where i can store my (fred hamster's)
  personal code without it getting in the way of the main feisty meow
  features.

feisty_meow_startup/
  Several examples of startup scripts that hook in the feisty meow script
  features.  The scripts can be integrated at a deep level, where they are
  always included at shell startup time, or at a more shallow level, where
  they are loaded on demand by invoking an alias.

legacy/
  Examples of quixotic attempts at whatever in the past.  One example is an
  aged attempt to add C++ template features to a C++ compiler that did not
  already have them.  It was never completely finished.

multimedia/
  Examples of multimedia processing that are not included in the main feisty
  meow corpus.

os_related/
  Both frivolous and serious scripts related to a particular operating system.
  Do *NOT* run the OS_crusher scripts unless you are in complete control of
  the system in question, and do not like that computer system very much,
  as they may likely take it down.
