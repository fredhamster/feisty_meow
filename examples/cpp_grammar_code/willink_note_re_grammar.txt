Hi Chris


[Please use Ed.Willink@thalesgroup.com for further coirrespondence. ]
The grammar's the most re-usable bit. Overall it came from my extended C++ language
FOG that allowed meta-execution at compile time ..,
It is very Open Source - no license at all. You may use it as you like. It would
be nice if you give an appropriate acknowledgement..
The ISO compliance is the result of best endeavours comparison and interpretation
rather than rigourous application of conformance suites.
Be aware that it is a context free syntax only parser. It requires a subsequent semantic
phase to resolve certain ambiguities that require type context.. If you need to
implement this, you really should read the Grammar chapter of my thesis posted
on the same site, and maybe use the FOG semantic parsing as a starting point.
I hope you make lots and lots of money, so that you may feel generously disposed
to giving me some.
Regards
Ed Willink

dear mr. willink,
first, thank you very much for posting your c++ grammar online. it is, well, awesome that it is compliant with the ansi standard.
i am wondering though about what copyrights apply to it. i am considering using the grammar in a project that might be included in a tool which might eventually be sold.
my concerns are: (1) is it appropriate to include your grammar in a GPLed open source application? and (2) do you allow the grammar to be used in a project that might be sold commercially without any royalty requirements for the use of it?
please feel free to push my nose into any FAQ sites or other information that may already be available. i came by your grammar from the site here: http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/compiler-dependencies.html#faq-37.11
and they were a bit skimpy on links to anything besides the grammar itself.
thanks for your time and i hope releasing this grammar has been more fun than trouble for you...
