# add this file to your ~/.bashrc if you want the feisty_meow scripts to be
# loaded up automatically.  this assumes your default shell is bash.
# ** this is for normal users, not the root user.

# note: it is often useful to set the NAME variable to identify who you are.
# the scripts will set up a bogus one for you otherwise.  for example:
#   export NAME='Frunkooleon Q. Grendervasp'

# don't bother running our stuff for dumb terminals, since any echo
# can mess with an sftp or scp connection, apparently.  similarly, we
# don't want any automatic startup stuff if we are running under PBS.
if [ "${TERM}" != "dumb" -a -z "$PBS_ENVIRONMENT" ]; then
  # sets up the feisty_meow scripts, using the default locations for all scripts.
