*  Author : Chris Koeritz                                                     *
*                                                                             *
*  Purpose:                                                                   *
*                                                                             *
*    Describes the database format.  The "fields" can be any kind of text,    *
*  including special characters.  The one reserved term is a line containing  *
*  a single tilde character ('~') followed by the appropriate line ending.    *
*  That marks the beginning of the next record.  Nechung will automatically   *
*  index the file based on these separators whenever the database changes.    *
*                                                                             *

The man in whom Tao
Acts without impediment
Harms no other being
By his actions
Yet he does not know himself
To be "kind," to be "gentle"
~
When an archer is shooting for nothing
He has all his skill.
If he shoots for a brass buckle
He is already nervous.
If he shoots for a prize of gold
He goes blind
Or sees two targets--
He is out of his mind!

His skill has not changed.  But the prize
Divides him.  He cares.
He thinks more of winning
Than of shooting--
And the need to win
Drains him of power.

By giving, resources; by ethics, bliss

what you don't see is what you get when you don't look
~
this bell's knelling is never quelled,
   while service is rendered,
tin staccato splattered over cupric strands,
   spraying crazed meaning to distant lands.
what is it?
~
To conquer oneself is a greater task than conquering others
