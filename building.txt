Quick Start for the Feisty Meow Codebase:

  Getting the Codebase:

    Retrieve a clone of the feisty meow codebase.

    git clone git://feistymeow.org:feisty_meow

    The rest of these notes assume that you stored the codebase in:
      ~/feisty_meow (aka $HOME/feisty_meow).

  Building the Codebase:

    Run the following command to build the Feisty Meow libraries and
    applications.
    Note that you may need to install some dependencies first (see below
    for dependency installation instructions).

    bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/generator/produce_feisty_meow.sh

    All the applications can be found in $FEISTY_MEOW_BINARIES
    after the build is complete.

  Cleaning the Codebase:

    This command cleans out all the generated files:

    bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/generator/whack_build.sh clean

  Loading the Feisty Meow scripting environment:

    Set up the feisty_meow scripts the first time; this is only needed once,
    unless you want to regenerate the scripts from the latest version.

    bash ~/feisty_meow/scripts/core/reconfigure_feisty_meow.sh

    Load the script environment into the current shell.

    source ~/feisty_meow/scripts/core/launch_feisty_meow.sh

    Loading the feisty meow script environment with the above command allows
    you to build specific projects in feisty meow by changing into the
    project's directory and running 'make'.

    Some example start-up files for loading feisty meow can be found in
    ~/feisty_meow/feisty_inits.

Feisty Meow Dependencies:

The feisty meow scripts depend on these scripting languages and tools:
  bash
  perl
    Text::Diff
    File::Which
  python
  gnumake

The feisty meow libraries and applications depend on these tools (see below
for installation steps):
  Gnu C++
  RTMP streams
  Curl
  Open SSL

====

How to install the most frequently needed compiler and library dependencies:

  Ubuntu / Debian:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential librtmp-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libssl-dev

  Centos / Redhat / Fedora:
    sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ openssl-devel.x86_64 curl-devel

  Cygwin + Windows:
    This is documented in ~/feisty_meow/doc/cygwin_install_list.txt

====

How to install the Feisty Meow script dependencies:

  cpan install Text::Diff File::Which

  These perl modules are required for a few of the feisty meow scripts to
  work properly.  The differ utility and the feisty meow customization system
  will be affected without these modules installed.
