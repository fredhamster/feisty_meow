This is the feisty meow scripts folder, which formerly formed the bulk of the
yeticode scripts collection.  We still love yetis however.

Folders contained herein include:

core/
    The most crucial scripts that we rely on in the codebase.  These are
responsible for bootstrapping the shell scripts and providing the variables
and core aliases that are most often needed.  The scripts in this folder also
provide an extensible way to load other aliases and variables to customize
the feisty meow yeti scripts.  There, we're still talking about yetis.
