this folder has some examples of how various people (or one person right now)
do their custom scripts.

the scripts should have the same name as the main yeti script's corresponding
name, but with a "c_" in front.

when you have some custom scripts you want to use, copy them from your own
folder to the scripts/custom directory.  be careful though, because these
will never be checked into the repository from there.
