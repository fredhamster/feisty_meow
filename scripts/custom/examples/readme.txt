this folder has some examples of how various people (or one person right now)
do their custom scripts.

the scripts often have the same name as the main script's name, but with
a "c_" in front.  ones understood currently are:
  c_common_aliases.txt
  c_sh_aliases.txt
  c_variables.sh

when you have some custom scripts you want to use, copy them from your own
folder to the scripts/custom directory.  be careful though, because these
will never be checked into the repository from there.
