this folder houses all of the feisty meow scripts that are considered
general purpose, rather than being hideously idiosyncratic and personal.
unfortunately not all weird scripts have been culled of their customizations
yet (and that work will probably go on for years).

many of these scripts were formerly known as "the yeticode collection", and
they even lived in their own domain yeticode.org.  this was before i stopped
buying new domain names on the merest of whims.  our effort of consolidating
these scripts into the feisty meow codebase has worked out really well.
but we still love yetis.
