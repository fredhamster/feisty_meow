this folder houses all of the feisty meow scripts that are considered general purpose,
rather than being hideously idiosyncratic and personal.  unfortunately not all weird
scripts have been culled to the customizations yet (and that work will probably go on for
years).

all of these scripts were formerly known as "the yeticode collection", and they even
lived in their own domain yeticode.org.  this was before i stopped buying a new domain
name on the merest whim.  consolidating them in with the codebase has worked a lot
better anyhow.  we still love yetis.
