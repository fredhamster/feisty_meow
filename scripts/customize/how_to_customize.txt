customizations are cool
=======================

this folder has some examples of customizations that override the default
feisty meow environment.

user customization folder organization
======================================

the user's optional custom folder is located at:
echo $FEISTY_MEOW_SCRIPTS/customize/$(logname)

the top-level of the customization folder can store:

+ alias files (ending in .alias) that are written in bash; these are added
  into the feisty meow environment as additional aliases.

+ sourceable bash scripts (ending in our bash extension of '.sh'); these
  will be pulled into the main-line of the script initialization process
  using the bash 'source' command.  these scripts can change or add any
  environment variables and aliases as needed, so be careful writing them.

custom script aliases
=====================

there is also a facility for adding aliases automatically for any custom
scripts that have been developed by the user.  these join the other aliases
provided by the feisty meow environment.

store any custom scripts in the folder:
$FEISTY_MEOW_SCRIPTS/customize/$(logname)/scripts

any scripts in that folder (or in a directory under that folder) will
automatically be turned into aliases.
