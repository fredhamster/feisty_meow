# in addition to the .bashrc code that the operating system gives you,
# you should added this file to your ~/.bashrc if you want the YETI scripts
# to be loaded up.
#
# you also must run bootstrap_shells.sh if you've never used YETI before.

# note: it is useful to set your own NAME variable to identify who you are.
# the yeti scripts will set up a bogus one for you otherwise.  in your home
# directory's .bashrc, you could add something like this, for example:
#export NAME='Curmudgeon J. Wankslausteen'

export TMP=/h/tmp

# add in some useful paths for the local machine.
