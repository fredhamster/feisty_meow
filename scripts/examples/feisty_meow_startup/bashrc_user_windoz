# you also must run bootstrap_shells.sh if you've never used feisty_meow before.

# note: it is useful to set your own NAME variable to identify who you are.
# the feisty_meow scripts will set up a bogus one for you otherwise.  in your home
# directory's .bashrc, you could add something like this, for example:
#export NAME='Curmudgeon J. Wankslausteen'

#export TMP=/h/tmp

# add in some useful paths for the local machine.
