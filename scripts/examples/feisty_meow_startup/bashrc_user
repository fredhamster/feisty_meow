# in addition to the .bashrc code that the operating system gives you,
# you can add this file to your ~/.bashrc if you want the feisty_meow scripts
# to be loaded up automatically.
#
# this is for normal users, not the root user!

# note: it is useful to set your own NAME variable to identify who you are.
# the feisty_meow scripts will set up a bogus one for you otherwise.  in your home
# directory's .bashrc, you could add something like this, for example:
#   export NAME='Doodmodeus Q. Nornberton'

# don't bother running our stuff for a dumb terminal since any echo
# can mess with an sftp or scp connection, apparently.  similarly, we
# don't want any automatic startup stuff if we are running under PBS.
if [ "${TERM}" != "dumb" -a -z "$PBS_ENVIRONMENT" ]; then
  # sets up the feisty_meow scripts, using the default locations for all scripts.
