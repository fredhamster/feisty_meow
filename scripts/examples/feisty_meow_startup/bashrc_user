# in addition to the .bashrc code that the operating system gives you,
# you can add this file to your ~/.bashrc if you want the YETI scripts
# to be loaded up automatically.
#
# this is for normal users, not the root user!

# note: it is useful to set your own NAME variable to identify who you are.
# the yeti scripts will set up a bogus one for you otherwise.  in your home
# directory's .bashrc, you could add something like this, for example:
#   export NAME='Doodmodeus Q. Nornberton'

# don't bother running our stuff for a dumb terminal since any echo
# can mess with an sftp connection, apparently.
if [ ${TERM} != "dumb" ]; then
  # make sure yeti code hasn't been explicitly disabled.
  if [ -z "$NO_YETI" ]; then
    # sets up the yeti scripts, using the default locations for all scripts.
