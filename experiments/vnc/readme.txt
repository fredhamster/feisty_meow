gooba hey hey

these vnc experiments are not at all working yet.

was trying, i think, to get a root window vnc working properly.
this is a super bad idea, i know, but it was for my own internal network,
which is already protected by firewalls and such, and was only for
certain machines,
plus we are not talking real root here, we are talking the root window,
so that i could actually remote control my own machines by logging in and
using X windows normally, but remotely, as if i was sitting at the console.
that's a damn noble aim (starting to remember more about the why of this
project) and should at some point be continued.
not this morning though, at 3am.  (2020-04-03)
