There are a few pre-built binaries included with this code distribution.
They originate from a few different sources.  Feel free to not trust them.

These apps are external to the feisty meow build...

production/win32_help hierarchy:
  unzip.exe & zip.exe:
    The zip and unzip tools are from the info-zip project.  They are somewhat
    antiquated but still work great on the various 32-bit windows platforms.
    These utilities are self-identified as: "Zip 2.3 (November 29th 1999)"
    To get a more recent version of the zip utilities or build them yourself,
    they can be found at the site: http://www.info-zip.org/

  short_path.exe:
    This tool is built by the code bootstrapping process (that is, by
    scripts/generator/bootstrap_build.sh), but unfortunately it is
    desperately needed for windows builds to work nicely with clam and
    bash.  If you don't have it, and your visual studio installation path
    has spaces in it, then you may have trouble bootstrapping.  You can
    manually change your VC root variable to a short path version, as
    reported by dir /x).  This tool can be replaced by any newer working
    version created by a bootstrap build.

  zap_process.exe
    A win32 tool that kills any process containing the name provided.
