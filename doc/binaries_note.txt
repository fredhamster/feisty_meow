There is one pre-built binary included with this code distribution
in the production/win32_helper folder.  Feel free to not trust it.

short_path.exe:
  This tool is built by the feisty meow application bootstrapping process
  (that is, by scripts/generator/bootstrap_build.sh), but unfortunately it is
  needed *by* that process when your visual studio installation path has
  spaces in it.  To fix this chicken & egg problem, you can manually change
  your VC root variable (e.g. VS100COMNTOOLS) to the short path version (as
  reported using "dir /x").
